<hr />

If you made it this far, it must mean you have an interest in RNG abusing a Pokemon from a hidden spawn! This page will cover the whole process, from finding a desirable location to achieving a final result.<br /> <br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Getting Started:</span></h3>
<u>Before starting, do the following:</u>
<ul>
  <li>Find an ideal location and weather condition for your Pokemon using the <a href="https://lincoln-lm.github.io/JS-Finder/Tools/SWSHEncounterSlots.html">SWSH Encounter-slots finder</a></li>
  <li>Head to the location in-game and stand near the grass, ideally with minimal NPCs or spawned Pokemon present.</li>
  <li>Press the Home button on your controller, click connect on the GUI, then fill in the details of your hunt on the GUI accordingly.
</ul>

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Time to get to work!</span></h3>
We will be aiming for a Sinistea-Antique in Glimwood Tangle, and our goal will be to walk into the grass to spawn a hidden encounter on the calculated target frame given to us by the RNG tool GUI. We will be using the advancement methods listed on the main page of this guide, primarily <u>day skip</u>, <u>bike</u> and <u>player movement</u> advances.<br /><br />

The species of a hidden encounter is determined by randomness, which means we need to work out the encounter slot value of our desired Pokemon. Using Sinistea-Antique as the example we can notice an encounter slot range of 99-99, a level range of 34-36 and is a hidden encounter in Glimwood Tangle. Lets enter this information into the GUI!<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Awesome, everything looks good!</span> Time to find an ideal position to stand in-game.<br /><br />

<u>This patch of grass in Glimwood Tangle is ideal, there are no NPCs around and there are no spawned Pokemon present, the same rules apply for other areas.</u><br /><br />

Once we have our RNG GUI filled in correctly and stood in position in-game, we can begin looking for our target Pokemon! In this example we'll be keeping it simple and aiming for any shiny Sinistea-Antique, you can be more specific with filters if you wish, such as filtering for marks and specific IVs.<br /><br />

If your results are not desirable, repeat the following:
<ol>
  <li>Disconnect your Switch from the GUI.</li>
  <li>Restart your game and enter the overworld.</li>
  <li>Enter the pause or Home menu and reconnect your Switch to the GUI.</li>
  <li>Search again, do this until you have desirable results.</li>
</ol>

<span class="fw-bold">We found one!</span> A shiny, Gentle natured Sinistea-Antique in at 19,139 and 19,141 advances. These are our target frames and we will aim to spawn the encounter on one of these two frames to encounter the Sinistea we are targeting.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 4 -</span> Target found!<br />
<img src="./hidden/figure-4-target-found-hidden.png" style="width:600px;height:300px;"><br /><br />

It's common to see clusters of shiny frames when searching for a target, a cluster is a group of target frames that all end with the same result. It's a good idea to aim for large clusters of shiny frames you put this guide into practice. The more duplicates in the cluster the more chances we will have at hitting our target Pokemon.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 5 -</span> Advancing closer to the target...<br />
<img src="./hidden/figure-5-hitting-target-hidden.png" style="width:600px;height:300px;"><br /><br />

We will aim to walk into the grass on frame 19,139... Patiently watch the <code>Curr adv.</code> box when you get within a few hundred frames of your target, when you see your target number on-screen, walk into the grass and initiate an encounter!<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 6/7 -</span> Result found!<br />

<img src="./hidden/figure-8-summary-screen-switch-hidden.png" style="width:600px;height:300px;"><br /><br />

After initiating the encounter, click the "Read Encounter" button to confirm what we hit. We can see the Sinistea matches up with the output of the GUI, mission accomplished!<br /><br />
