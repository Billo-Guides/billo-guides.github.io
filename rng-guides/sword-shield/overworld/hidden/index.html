<hr />

If you made it this far, it must mean you have an interest in RNG abusing a Pokemon from a hidden spawn! This page will cover the whole process, from finding a desirable location to achieving a final result.<br /> <br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Getting Started:</span></h3>
<u>Before starting, do the following:</u>
<ul>
  <li>Find an ideal location and weather condition for your Pokemon using the <a href="https://lincoln-lm.github.io/JS-Finder/Tools/SWSHEncounterSlots.html">SWSH Encounter-slots finder</a></li>
  <li>Head to the location in-game and stand near the grass, ideally with no other NPCs or spawned Pokemon present.</li>
  <li>If there are overworld spawns in the area, run far enough away so the Pokemon is despawned, save, then reboot the game to the overworld.</li>
  <li>Press the Home button on your controller, click connect on the GUI, then fill in the details of your hunt on the GUI accordingly.
</ul>

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Time to get to work!</span></h3>
We will be aiming for a Sinistea-Antique in Glimwood Tangle, and our goal will be to walk into the grass to spawn a hidden encounter on the calculated target frame given to us by the RNG tool GUI. We will be using the advancement methods listed in the main page of this guide, primarily day skip, bike and player movement advances.<br /><br />

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Time to get to work!</span></h3>

The species of a hidden encounter is determined by randomness, which means we need to work out the encounter slot value of our desired Pokemon. Using Sinistea-Antique as the example we can notice an encounter slot range of 99-99, a level range of 34-36 and is a hidden encounter in Glimwood Tangle. Lets enter this information into the GUI!<br /><br />

Awesome! Everything looks good, time to find an ideal position to stand in-game!<br />

<u>This patch of grass in Glimwood Tangle is ideal, there are no NPCs around and there are no spawned Pokemon present, the same rules apply for other areas.</u><br /><br />
