<hr />

If you made it this far, it must mean you have an interest in RNG abusing Pokémon from a static spawn! This page will cover the whole process, from finding a desirable location to achieving a final result.<br /> <br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Getting Started:</span></h3>
<u>Before starting, do the following:</u>
<ul>
  <li>Find an ideal location and weather condition for your Pokémon using the <code>Encounter Lookup</code> tab of the RNG tool.</li>
  <li>Click on the row you prefer, this will enter all the information you need into the <code>Seed Finder</code> tab automatically.</li>
  <li>Head to the location in-game and stand near the spawn point of the Pokémon, ideally with minimal NPCs or other spawned Pokémon present.</li>
  <li>Run far enough away to despawn the Pokémon and save.</li>
  <li>Press the Home button on your controller, click <code>Connect</code> on the <code>Seed Finder</code> tab of the tool.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Time to get to work!</span></h3>
The goal is to walk towards our encounter and spawn it on the calculated target frame given by the generator. The advancement methods used are listed on the main page of this guide, <u>day skip</u>, <u>bike</u> and <u>player movement</u> advances will be used for this example.<br /><br />

If you plan to use the <code>DaySkip</code> feature you should take note of how many frames advance per day skipped to make sure you don't overshoot your target.<br /><br />

Static encounters are guaranteed to be the same species every time until the weather in the area changes, weather changes on each new day. This means the encounter will be guaranteed if the correct weather is present!<br /><br />

We will be aiming for a Shiny, Marked Duraludon in Giant's Seat. You can be more specific with the filters if you wish, such as filtering for a specific mark or specific IVs.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Awesome, everything looks good!</span> Time to find an ideal position to stand in-game and set the weather condition.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 2 -</span> Game setup<br />
<img src="./images/static/figure-2-in-game-setup.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br />

<u>This location in Giant's Seat is ideal, there are no NPCs around and there are no spawned Pokémon present, the same rules apply for other areas.</u><br /><br />

Once the <code>Seed Finder</code> tab is filled in correctly & you are stood in a good position in-game, you can begin looking for target frames by clicking the search button on the generator.<br /><br />

<u>If your results are not desirable, repeat the following:</u>
<ol>
  <li>Disconnect your Switch from the tool.</li>
  <li>Restart your game and enter the overworld.</li>
  <li>Enter the pause or Home menu and reconnect your Switch to the tool.</li>
  <li>Search again, do this until you have desirable results.</li>
</ol>

<span class="fw-bold">We found one!</span> A shiny, Adamant natured Duraludon in a cluster on advances 1000-1001. These are the target frames for this example and we'll be walking towards the spawn point of the Duraludon on any of these frames.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure  3 -</span> Target found!<br />
<img src="./images/static/figure-3-static-search-duraludon.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

It's common to see clusters of shiny frames when searching for a target, a cluster is a group of target frames that all end with the same result. It's a good idea to aim for large clusters of shiny frames when you put this guide into practice. The more duplicates in the cluster the more chances we will have at hitting our target Pokémon.<br /><br />

Advance the RNG state while watching the <code>Curr adv.</code> box, head towards the spawn point of the Pokémon when you see your target number on-screen.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">We hit our target frame!</span> If you believe you spawned the Pokémon on the correct frame, run towards the it and initiate the encounter, once you are in-battle use the <code>Read Encounter</code> feature of the generator to confirm the Pokémon you are in battle with matches the output of the generator.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 5/6/7 -</span> Result Found!<br />

The Duraludon matches the output of the tool, mission accomplished! Espeon in party slot 1 with the ability Syncronize was used to determine the nature, using a Pokémon with this ability will make the nature of any overworld Pokémon match the nature of yours.<br /><br />

Different areas & environments can have a drastic influence on delay, if you are missing targets when you believe you should be finding results, you should consider reading the Troubleshooting Encounters section down below.<br /><br />

<hr />

This section covers how to troubleshoot encounters and delays. If you keep missing targets, spawning in the wrong Pokémon, or can't find your result on the RNG tool, this is the place to be.<br /><br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Missing Targets:</span></h3>
<u>The commonly occuring reasons for missing a target Pokémon are:</u>
<ul>
  <li>Encounter did not spawn.</li>
  <li>Encounter spawned too late due to mistiming.</li>
  <li>There is a delay left unaccounted for.</li>
  <li>Information in the <code>Seed Finder</code> tab was not completely accurate.</li>
</ul>

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Encounter did not spawn or spawned too late...</span></h5>

This is a common issue players will face when tackling static encounters. Simply retry and search for a new target frame and make sure your player positioning is correct.<br /><br />

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Troubleshooting delay...</span></h5>

Most static encounters do not need to account for delay, this applies most to encounters in extreme weather conditions or in an otherwise unstable environment, like having other spawned Pokémon present. Your delay is calculated by <code>frame hit - Frame initated = delay</code>. We can use the <code>Read Encounter</code> feature of the tool to confirm the frame we are hitting and see if we need to account for any delay. Here's how it's done!
<ul>
  <li>Aim for a target, such as any shiny Pokémon.</li>
  <li>Walk towards the grass, spawn the Pokemon and initiate an encounter. Take note of the frame you the Pokémon was spawned on.</li>
  <li>Encounter the Pokemon and click the <code>Read Encounter</code> button if you didn't find the Pokémon what you expected.</li>
  <li>Do a filterless search and find the frame you hit, take note of the number and subtract the target frame number from it.</li>
  <li>This will be your delay for that particular encounter.</li>
</ul>

<u>When RNG abusing in unstable conditions you should record delays for multiple attempts before aiming for a target and check for any consistent delay counts. It is also advised to aim for large clusters where possible to increase your chances of actually hitting the target.</u><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 8 -</span> Delay troubleshooting example<br />
<img src="./images/static/figure-8-troubleshooting-encounters.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

We encountered an Duraludon, but it wasn't shiny! So what happened here? Well... We miscalculated. Let's try to find the frame we actually hit.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 9 -</span> Finding the frame<br />
<img src="./images/static/figure-9-locating-frame.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

By doing a filterless search we can see the the shiny cluster, and frame we hit was 2 frames behind where we wanted to be, oh well! We will adjust accordingly for next time by walking into the grass 2 frames later.<br /><br />

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Cannot find result...</span></h5>
If you cannot find the Pokémon you are in battle with anywhere on the tool this is likely due to one of two reasons:
<ul>
  <li>Player was positioned too close to the spawn and the Pokémon had already been generated long before walking into it.</li>
  <li>The information entered into the <code>Seed Finder</code> tab of the tool was not completely accurate.</li>
</ul>

Try to reposition your character and see if your issue persists, if you are still having problems double check the information on the <code>Seed Finder</code> tab is entered correctly by searching it on the Encounter Lookup and clicking the correct row. <u>You must pay attention to the row you are clicking and making sure it matches your in-game environment.</u><br /><br />

That's all there is to it!<br /><br />
