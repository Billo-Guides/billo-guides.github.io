<hr />

If you made it this far, it must mean you have an interest in RNG abusing Pokémon from a symbol encounter! This page will cover the whole process, from finding a desirable location to achieving a final result.<br /> <br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Getting Started:</span></h3>
<u>Before starting, do the following:</u>
<ul>
  <li>Find a symbol encounter in an ideal location and weather condition for your Pokémon using the <code>Encounter Lookup</code> tab of the RNG tool.</li>
  <li>Click on the row you prefer, this will enter all the information you need into the <code>Seed Finder</code> tab automatically.</li>
  <li>Head to the location in-game and stand close to a patch of grass in the area, ideally with minimal NPCs or other spawned Pokémon present.</li>
  <li>Run far enough away to despawn the Pokémon in the grass and save.</li>
  <li>Press the Home button on your controller, click <code>Connect</code> on the <code>Seed Finder</code> tab of the tool.</li>
</ul>

<h5><span class="fw-bold">The KO mechanic:</span></h5>
This references the <code>Number Battled:</code> screen of the Pokédex and is used to boost the odds of (Shiny) Brilliant Aura Pokémon. On this screen you are able to view the total amount of KO'd Pokémon per species in your entire save file.<br /> <br />

<span class="fw-bold">The number of Pokémon battled is important to symbol encounters and needs to be entered into the tool manually or you will not get accurate results from the generator!</span> Check the amount of KOs you have on the Pokemon you are hunting before starting.<br /> <br />

Want to know the odds based on the total amount of KOs? <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Brilliant_Pok%C3%A9mon">This article on Bulbapedia</a> will tell you everything you need to know.<br /> <br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Time to get to work!</span></h3>
The goal is to walk towards our grass and spawn the overworld model of the Pokémon on the calculated target frame given by the generator. The advancement methods used are listed on the main page of this guide, <u>day skip</u>, <u>bike</u> and <u>player movement</u> advances will be used for this example.<br /><br />

If you plan to use the <code>DaySkip</code> feature you should take note of how many frames advance per day skipped to make sure you don't overshoot your target.<br /><br />

We will be aiming for a Shiny, Marked Swablu with a Brilliant Aura in Giant's Bed. You can be more specific with the filters if you wish, such as filtering for a specific mark or specific IVs.<br /><br />

Brilliant Aura guarantees 2 full 31 IVs, players who desire high IV wild caught Pokémon may wish to filter for Brilliant Aura.<br /><br />

<u>Using Swablu as the example:</u><br />
- The <code>Encounter Lookup</code> tab tells us that Swablu has an encounter slot range of 80-94, a level range of 60-65 and is a symbol encounter in Overcast weather. It also tells us Swablu does not hold a random item and has 7 potential Egg Moves.<br />
- Our Pokédex tells us we have >500 KOs on Swablu.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Let's enter this information into the <code>Seed Finder</code> tab by clicking the row that matches our conditions!</span><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 1 -</span> Tool setup<br />
<img src="./images/symbol/figure-1-encounter-lookup-symbol-swablu.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Awesome, everything looks good!</span> Time to find an ideal position to stand in-game and set the weather condition.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 2 -</span> Game setup<br />
<img src="./images/symbol/figure-2-in-game-setup.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br />

<u>This location in Giant's Bed is ideal, there are no NPCs around and there was a static Nidoqueen present but we were able to KO it and now the area has no extra unwanted spawns. The same rules apply for other areas.</u><br /><br />

Once the <code>Seed Finder</code> tab is filled in correctly & you are stood in a good position in-game, you can begin looking for target frames by clicking the search button on the generator.<br /><br />

<u>If your results are not desirable, repeat the following:</u>
<ol>
  <li>Disconnect your Switch from the tool.</li>
  <li>Restart your game and enter the overworld.</li>
  <li>Enter the pause or Home menu and reconnect your Switch to the tool.</li>
  <li>Search again, do this until you have desirable results.</li>
</ol>

<span class="fw-bold">We found one!</span> A shiny, NatureHere natured Swablu in a cluster on advances x-y. These are the target frames for this example and we'll be walking towards the spawn point of the Swablu on any of these frames.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure  3 -</span> Target found!<br />
<img src="./images/symbol/figure-3-target-found-symbol.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

It's common to see clusters of shiny frames when searching for a target, a cluster is a group of target frames that all end with the same result. It's a good idea to aim for large clusters of shiny frames when you put this guide into practice. The more duplicates in the cluster the more chances we will have at hitting our target Pokémon.<br /><br />

Advance the RNG state while watching the <code>Curr adv.</code> box, head towards the spawn point of the Pokémon when you see your target number on-screen.<br /><br />

<img src="./images/symbol/figure-4-hitting-target-symbol.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">We hit our target frame!</span> If you believe you spawned the Pokémon on the correct frame, run towards the it and initiate the encounter, once you are in-battle use the <code>Read Encounter</code> feature to confirm the Pokémon you are in battle with matches the output of the generator.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 5/6/7 -</span> Result found!<br />

The Swablu matches the output of the tool, mission accomplished! Espeon in party slot 1 with the ability Syncronize was used to determine the nature, using a Pokémon with this ability will make the nature of any overworld Pokémon match the nature of yours.<br /><br />

Different areas & environments can have a drastic influence on delay, if you are missing targets when you believe you should be finding results, you should consider reading the Troubleshooting Encounters section down below.<br /><br />

<hr />

<div class="bg-secondary title">
  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Troubleshooting Encounters</h1>
</div>

<hr />

This section covers how to troubleshoot encounters and delays. If you keep missing targets, spawning in the wrong Pokémon, or can't find your result on the RNG tool, this is the place to be.<br /><br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Missing Targets:</span></h3>
The commonly occuring reasons for missing a target Pokémon are:
<ul>
  <li>Encounter did not spawn.</li>
  <li>Encounter spawned too late due to mistiming.</li>
  <li>There is a delay left unaccounted for.</li>
  <li>Frame was "hit" but an incorrect species of Pokémon was encountered.</li>
  <li>Information in the <code>Seed Finder</code> tab was not completely accurate.</li>
</ul>

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Encounter did not spawn or spawned too late...</span></h5>

This is a common issue players will face when tackling symbol encounters. Simply retry and search for a new target frame and make sure your player positioning is correct.<br /><br />

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Troubleshooting delay...</span></h5>

Some symbol encounters do not need to account for delay, this mostly applies to encounters in extreme weather conditions or in an otherwise unstable environment, like having other spawned Pokémon present. Your delay is calculated by <code>frame hit - Frame initated = delay</code>. We can use the <code>Read Encounter</code> feature of the GUI to confirm the frame we are hitting and see if we need to account for any delay. Here's how it's done!
<ul>
  <li>Aim for a target, such as any shiny Pokémon.</li>
  <li>Walk towards the grass, spawn the Pokemon and initiate an encounter. Take note of the frame you the Pokémon was spawned on.</li>
  <liEncounter the Pokemon and click the <code>Read Encounter</code> button if you didn't find the Pokémon what you expected.</li>
  <li>Do a filterless search and find the frame you hit, take note of the number and subtract the target frame number from it.</li>
  <li>This will be your delay for that particular encounter.</li>
</ul>

<u>When RNG abusing in unstable conditions you should record delays for multiple attempts before aiming for a target and check for any consistent delay counts. It is also advised to aim for large clusters where possible to increase your chances of actually hitting the target.</u><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 8 -</span> Delay troubleshooting example<br />
<img src="./images/symbol/figure-8-troubleshooting-delay.png" style="width:675px;height:400px"><br /><br />

We hit a shiny, but it wasn't Swablu! So what happened here? We actually hit a different frame within a shiny cluster which contained the encounter slot values for NidoranF, we can take a look by locating the exact NidoranF encounter in the <code>Encounter Lookup</code> tab and clicking search again. <br /><br />

<u>If the Pokemon you find is non shiny you will need to be more specific with your filters, include the exact IVs displayed in the <code>Read Encounter</code> box to easily find the frame that you hit.</u><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 9 -</span> Troubleshooting Encounter-slots<br />
<img src="./images/symbol/figure-9-finding-frame-symbol.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px"><br /><br />

Here we can see NidoranF was indeed a shiny Pokémon within the cluster (Encounterslot value of 26-51 according to Encounter Lookup). Our goal was frame 3,001 and we hit frame 3,003, the tool shows these values are a match 1-2 frames later than our desired target frame, we will adjust accordingly for next time by walking into the grass 2 frames earlier next time.<br /><br />

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Cannot find result...</span></h5>
If you cannot find the Pokémon you are in battle with anywhere on the tool this is likely due to one of two reasons:
<ul>
  <li>Player was positioned too close to the spawn and the Pokémon had already been generated long before walking into it.</li>
  <li>The information entered into the <code>Seed Finder</code> tab of the tool was not completely accurate.</li>
</ul>

Try to reposition your character and see if your issue persists, if you are still having problems double check the information on the <code>Seed Finder</code> tab is entered correctly by searching it on the Encounter Lookup and clicking the correct row. <u>You must pay attention to the row you are clicking and making sure it matches your in-game environment.</u><br /><br />

That's all there is to it!<br /><br />
