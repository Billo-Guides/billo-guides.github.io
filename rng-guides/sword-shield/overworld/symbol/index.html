<hr />

If you made it this far, it must mean you have an interest in RNG abusing Pokemon from a symbol encounter! This page will cover the whole process, from finding a desirable location to achieving a final result.<br /> <br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Getting Started:</span></h3>
<u>Before starting, do the following:</u>
<ul>
  <li>Find an ideal location and weather condition for your Pokemon using the <a href="https://lincoln-lm.github.io/JS-Finder/Tools/SWSHEncounterSlots.html">SWSH Encounter-slots finder</a></li>
  <li>Head to the location in-game and stand near the grass, ideally with minimal NPCs or spawned Pokemon present.</li>
  <li>Run far enough away to despawn the Pokemon in the grass and save.</li>
  <li>Press the Home button on your controller, click connect on the GUI, then fill in the details of your hunt on the GUI accordingly.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Important Information:</span></h3>
<u>Rand Held Items & egg moves...</u><br />
The <code>Rand Held Item</code> checkbox should be checked if your Pokemon can hold an item when found in a wild encounter. It is also important to fill in the <code>Possible EMs</code> field correctly to ensure accurate predictions from the RNG tool.<br /> <br />

You can quickly find the information you need using LegoFigure11's <a href="https://legofigure11.github.io/misc/swsh-owrng-encounter-details/">SWSH OWRNG encounter details tool</a>.<br /> <br />

<u>Brilliant Aura...</u><br />
This is the <a href="https://www.serebii.net/swordshield/brilliantaura.shtml">yellow glow</a> occasionally present on symbol encounters. Brilliant Aura Pokemon are guaranteed to have 2-3 full 31 IVs, this makes them ideal for those who wish to RNG abuse high IV wild Pokemon.<br /> <br />

<u>The KO mechanic...</u><br />
This is a mechanic used to increase the odds of Brilliant Aura and shiny odds of Pokemon <u>with</u> Brilliant Aura. It is advised to KO at least 100 of a specific species if you wish to significantly increase the odds of finding Brilliant Aura. <a href="https://twitter.com/Sibuna_Switch/status/1448334955461939210">This Twitter thread by Anubis</a> contains a more detailed break down of odds and statistics. It is important that KO counts are correctly entered into the GUI.<br /> <br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Time to get to work!</span></h3>
We will be aiming for a Swablu in Giant's Bed, and our goal will be to walk towards the grass to spawn a symbol encounter on the calculated target frame given to us by the RNG tool. We will be using the advancement methods listed on the main page of this guide, primarily <u>day skip</u>, <u>bike</u> and <u>player movement</u> advances.<br /><br />

The species of symbol encounters is determined by randomness, which means we need to work out the encounter slot value of our desired Pokemon. Using Swablu as the example we can notice an encounter slot range of 80-94, a level range of 60-65 and is a symbol encounter in Overcast weather. Lets enter this information into the GUI!<br /><br />

<img src="./symbol/figure-2-gui-connected-filled.png" style="width:600px;height:300px;"><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Awesome, everything looks good!</span> Time to find an ideal position to stand in-game and check the weather condition. If the weather is not sunny, select the <code>Weather</code> checkbox in the GUI.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 4 -</span> Checking the weather condition<br />
<img src="./symbol/figure-4-checking-weather-condition.jpg" style="width:600px;height:300px;"><br /><br />

<u>This location in Giant's Bed is ideal, there are no NPCs around and there are no spawned Pokemon present, the same rules apply for other areas.</u><br /><br />

Once we have our RNG GUI filled in correctly and stood in position in-game, we can begin looking for our target Pokemon! In this example we'll be keeping it simple and aiming for any shiny Swablu with a Brilliant Aura, you can be more specific with filters if you wish, such as filtering for marks and specific IVs.<br /><br />

If your results are not desirable, repeat the following:
<ol>
  <li>Disconnect your Switch from the GUI.</li>
  <li>Restart your game and enter the overworld.</li>
  <li>Enter the pause or Home menu and reconnect your Switch to the GUI.</li>
  <li>Search again, do this until you have desirable results.</li>
</ol>

<span class="fw-bold">We found one!</span> A shiny, Jolly natured Swablu in a cluster on advances 42-48 , we got quite lucky here! These are our target frames and walk towards the grass to spawn our Swablu on any one of these target frames.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure  5 -</span> Target found!<br />
<img src="./symbol/figure-5-target-found-symbol.png" style="width:600px;height:300px;"><br /><br />

It's common to see clusters of shiny frames when searching for a target, a cluster is a group of target frames that all end with the same result. It's a good idea to aim for large clusters of shiny frames when you put this guide into practice. The more duplicates in the cluster the more chances we will have at hitting our target Pokemon.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure  6 -</span> Advancing closer to the target...<br />
<img src="./symbol/figure-6-hitting-target-symbol.png" style="width:600px;height:300px;"><br /><br />

We will aim to walk into the grass on frame 42-48... Patiently watch the <code>Curr adv.</code> box when you get within a close frame range of your target, when you see your target number on-screen, walk towards the grass and spawn the Pokemon! Run into it and confirm you hit the correct result.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 7/8/9 -</span> Result found!<br />
<img src="./symbol/figure-7-in-battle-encounter-read-symbol.png" style="width:600px;height:300px;"><br /><br />
<img src="./symbol/figure-8-in-battle-encounter-switch-symbol.jpg" style="width:600px;height:300px;"><br /><br />
<img src="./symbol/figure-9-summary-screen-switch-symbol.jpg" style="width:600px;height:300px;"><br /><br />

After initiating the encounter, click the "Read Encounter" button to confirm what we hit. We can see the Swablu matches up with the output of the GUI, mission accomplished!<br /><br />

It's important to note that different areas and/or environments can have a drastic influence on delay, if you are missing targets when you believe you should be finding results consider reading the Troubleshooting Encounters section down below.<br /><br />

<hr />

<div class="bg-secondary title">
  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Troubleshooting Encounters</h1>
</div>

<hr />

This section covers how to troubleshoot encounters and delays. If you miss a target, spawning in the wrong Pokemon, or can't find your result on the GUI, this is the place to be.<br /><br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Missing Targets:</span></h3>
The commonly occuring reasons for missing a target Pokemon are:
<ul>
  <li>Encounter did not spawn.</li>
  <li>Encounter spawned too late due to overstepping.</li>
  <li>There is a delay left unaccounted for.</li>
  <li>Frame was "hit" but incorrect species of Pokemon was encountered.</li>
</ul>

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Encounter did not spawn or spawned too late...</span></h5>

This is a common issue players will face when tackling symbol encounters. Simply retry and search for a new target frame and make sure your player positioning is correct.<br /><br />

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Troubleshooting delay...</span></h5>

Most symbol encounters do not need to account for delay, this mostly applies to encounters in extreme weather conditions or in an otherwise unstable environment, like having other spawned Pokemon present. Your delay is calculated by <code>frame hit - Frame initated = delay</code>. We can use the <code>Read Encounter</code> feature of the GUI to confirm the frame we are hitting and see if we need to account for any delay. Here'x how it's done!
<ul>
  <li>Aim for a target, such as any shiny Pokemon.</li>
  <li>Walk towards the grass, spawn the Pokemon and initiate an encounter. Take note of the frame you the Pokemon was spawned on.</li>
  <liEncounter the Pokemon and click the <code>Read Encounter</code> button if you didn't find the Pokemon what you expected.</li>
  <li>Do a filterless search and find the frame you hit, take note of the number and subtract the target frame number from it.</li>
  <li>This will be your delay for that particular encounter.</li>
</ul>

<u>If you are RNG abusing in unstable conditions you should record delays for multiple attempts before aiming for a target and check for any consistent delay counts. It is also advised to aim for large clusters where possible to increase your chances of actually hitting the target.</u><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 10 -</span> Delay troubleshooting example<br />
<img src="./symbol/figure-10-troubleshooting-delay.png" style="width:600px;height:300px;"><br /><br />

We hit a shiny, but it wasn't Swablu! So what happened here? We actually hit a different frame within a shiny cluster which contained the encounterslot values for Linoone, let's take a look by setting the encounter slot range to 0-99.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 11 -</span> Finding the frame<br />
<img src="./symbol/figure-11-findng-the-frame.png" style="width:600px;height:300px;"><br /><br />

Here we can see the the shiny cluster, and Linoone was indeed a shiny Pokemon within the cluster (Encounterslot value of 70-79). We ended up 1-2 frames later than desired and will adjust accordingly for next time by walking into the grass 1-2 frames earlier.<br /><br />

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Cannot find result...</span></h5>
If you cannot find your result on the tool this is likely because the Pokemon you encountered does or does not have a random held item and the box is incorrectly checked on the GUI. Click the rand held item box and search again to find the frame you actually hit.<br /><br />

If you are adamant that you have filled in the GUI correctly consider repositioning yourself in-game.<br /><br />

That's all there is to it!<br /><br />
