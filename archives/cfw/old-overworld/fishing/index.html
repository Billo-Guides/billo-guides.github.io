<p>This guide explains how to RNG abuse Pokémon from Fishing encounters. It covers the entire process, from choosing a location to obtaining the desired Pokémon.</p>

<p>Fishing encounters aren't guaranteed to be the same species each time. The species is determined by an encounter slot value of 0-99, which changes with the weather. The weather can change every day at midnight (00:00). Be mindful of the Switch system time to avoid spawning unexpected Pokémon due to incorrect weather conditions.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #b60606;">From here it is assumed that you have read the initial page of this guide and have a general idea of how to use SWSH OWRNG Generator GUI.</span></p>

<p>The Encounter Lookup specifies Slumbering Weald with Overcast weather for this encounter. Clicking the row of the table automatically fills in all of the relevant encounter information on the left-hand side of the main window.</p>

<p>KO Count has been manually configured to match the amount displayed in Whiscash's PokeDex entry for my save file (500 KOs applies maximum Brilliant Aura bonus).</p>

<p>The search filters, in the middle of the main window, were manually configured to search for any shiny with any mark, you can be more specific with the filters if you wish, such as filtering for IVs/Nature.</p>

            <p>Brilliant Aura boosts the amount of guaranteed 31 IVs a Pokémon has, only Pokémon from symbol & fishing encounters can have this trait. This makes these encounters ideal for those who are hunting for high IV wild Pokémon.</p>

<p>The end goal is to spawn a fishing pool in the area that contains the Pokémon you are hunting on the calculated target frame provided by the generator search results. Once a pool spawns in the overworld, its stats and details are fixed until it disappears.</p>

<p>Ensure your encounter and search filters are properly configured before continuing (see Figure 1). The advancement methods used to achieve the result are listed in the table found on the main page.</p>

    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>For Fishing encounters, stand directly next to a fishing pool in the area that contains your desired Pokémon. Avoid areas that trigger other Wild/Static spawns. Once you have good positioning, calculate the amount of NPCs using the method described on the main page of the guide.</p>

        <p>The location in the above image is ideal: Minimal NPCs, no extra spawned Pokémon, and standing directly next to a fishing pool.</p>

        <p>Slumbering Weald is a notably "quiet" area. Remember, advancement speed (aka noise) depends on location, NPC count, and weather. The more quiet the area, the better.</p>

<p>After searching a desired result, we've found a shiny, Hardy natured Whiscash in a cluster on advances 271-274. Target frames often appear in clusters, which are multiple frames in a row yield the same result. A larger cluster increases your chances of hitting the target frame.</p>

    <summary><span class="fw-bold">Undesirable result?</span></summary>
    <ol>
        <li>Disconnect from the program, and restart the game to refresh the seed.</li>

        <li>Search for a new target frame, repeat this process until a desirable result shows in the generator search results.</li>

    <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Advancing Towards the Target!</h1>
</div>
<hr />

<p>First, you will need to calculate the rough delay for the encounter. Doing this step will provide the best possible chances of hitting your target frame. Delay is the difference in advancements between spawning the Pokémon in the overworld and the actual frame the Pokémon was generated on.</p>

<div class="card border-dark">
    <div class="anchored card-header" style="background-color: #0c0038;" id="delay-calculation-cfw">
        <span class="fw-bold text-light">Delay Calculation</span>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <h6 span class="fw-bold">Delay Calculation</h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Stand next to a fishing pool in the area that contains your desired Pokémon, despawn it by mounting then dismounting your bike.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Pause the game with the pool despawned, then disconnect and reconnect to the main window. The number inside the <code class="fw-bold">Curr. Adv.</code> field should now be 0.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Unpause the game and wait a few seconds for a fishing pool to spawn, take note of the frame it was spawned on.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Initiate the encounter, the press the <code class="fw-bold">Read Encounter</code> button to see the details of the Pokémon you are in battle with.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Search with no filters to find the frame you actually hit. This should be relatively close to the frame the Pokémon was spawned on.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Subtract the frame the Pokémon was spawned on from the frame you actually hit, this will be your rough delay for this encounter.</li>
        </ol>

        <blockquote><span class="fw-bold">Example:</span> If we spawned the fishing pool on frame 150, but the Pokémon we are in battle with was generated on frame 152, the calculated delay is 2.</blockquote>

    </div>
</div>
<br>

<p>At this stage you should now know have calibrated both the NPC count and the delay for the encounter, take note of both of these values as they are significantly important for hitting target frames consistently.</p>

<p>Take note of your position after calibrating delay and NPC count as these values are subjective to change based on the positioning of the player.</p>

<p>After setting up your search filters and standing in the correct position in-game, you will need to calculate the amount of NPCs in the area and the base delay of the encounter. Doing both of these things will provide the best possible chances of hitting the correct target frame.</p>

    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <h6 class="fw-bold">Step-by-step tutorial:</h6>

        <ul>
            <li>Advance towards your target frame using any method listed in the table on the main page (consider date-skipping for long distance-advancements).</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Return to the correct position in-game when you are a few thousand frames away from the desired target. Ensure the target fishing pool is despawned.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Pause the game, then disconnect and reconnect to the Main Window, and press the search button again to set a new target frame.</li>
            <p></p>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>At this stage, we recommend using menu close prediction & animation advancements for accurate, small, and manageable advancement increments.</blockquote>

        <ul>
            <li>Open the Menu Close Advances Viewer tab, and enter the number of NPCs calculated earlier in the <code span class="fw-bold">NPCs</code> field.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Enter your target frame into the empty <code span class="fw-bold">+</code> field, factor in your calibrated delay (e.g <code span class="fw-bold">1000 (target) - 3 (delay) = 997 (new target)</code>).</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Hit search, you should now see a list of frames in the table, see if your exact target frame, great! This means menu close prediction can be used to hit it.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>If you do not see your target frame in the search results, use animation advancements to increment the RNG state by 1, then repeat the above steps until visible.</li>
            <p></p>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>
            <p>In rare cases, you may not be able to hit the desired frame using menu close prediction alone. Use it to get as close as possible, then use movement advances to reach your target instead.</p>

            Test how many advancements occur per movement to determine the number needed. Typically, this method advances the RNG state by 1-2 frames each time.
        </blockquote>

        <ul>
            <li>Open and close the pause menu until a single menu close lands you onto (or as close as possible) the target frame.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Unpause the game, then wait for the fishing pool to spawn in the overworld, do not mount your bike after doing so.</li>
            <p></p>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>If you do not land directly onto your target frame, this is the point where you should use movement advancements, do this before spawning the fishing pool in the overworld.</blockquote>

        <ul>
            <li>Initiate the encounter with the Pokémon that spawned first to check if you've hit the correct target frame. If the result is unexpected, recalibrate your NPC count and delay, then retry.</li>
        </ul>

    </div>
</div>
<br>

<p>By using menu close prediction and animations to keep track of inputs/advancements, we were able to hit out target frame.</p>
