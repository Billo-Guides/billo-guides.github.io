<p>This section explains how to RNG abuse Pokémon from Symbol encounters on retail hardware. It covers the entire process, from choosing a location to obtaining the desired Pokémon.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #b60606;">From here it is assumed that you have read the initial page of this guide and have a general idea of how to use SWSH OWRNG Generator GUI, as well as understanding how to find and monitor your seed.</span></p>

        <span class="fw-bold text-light">About Symbol Encounters:</span>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>Symbol spawners are NOT guaranteed to produce the same species every time, the species is instead derived from the encounterslot value (0-99), the Pokémon that occupy encounterslots will vary depending on weather and location.</p>
        <hr />

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">Brilliant Aura Mechanics</span></h6>
        <p>Symbol encounters can potentially spawn Pokémon with Brilliant Aura, which boosts the amount of guaranteed max IVs the Pokémon will have. Players searching for high IV targets may opt for manipulating Symbol encounters for this purpose.</p>

        <p>Brilliant Aura Pokémon can also have increased shiny odds, which is based on the Pokedex KO count. This value can be seen by viewing the Pokedex entry of any Pokémon. <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Brilliant_Pok%C3%A9mon#Appearance_rate">Bulbapedia</a> contains useful information about the increased rates.</p>

        <p>For maximum optimization with this encounter type, it is recommended to have access to the Shiny Charm and have 500 KOs on the Pokémon you are hunting, this is a time consuming process however.</p>
        <hr />

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">Pokemon Behaviour Mechanics</span></h6>
        <p>Pokémon have different behaviour classes, some will be aggressive and target the player, others will be relaxed, and in some cases the Pokémon will be timid and flee when they notice the player, causing them to despawn entirely. Pokémon with flee behaviour need to be encountered quickly before they escape.</p>

        <u>Pokémon with flee behaviour:</u><br>
        <p>Butterfree, Vulpix, Chansey, Horsea, Dunsparce, Blissey, Ralts, Whismur, Drilbur, Audino, Trubbish, Zorua, Ferroseed, Inkay, Phantump, Noibat, Wimpod, Skwovet &amp; Silicobra.</p>

        <p>If the Pokémon you intend to hunt appears in this list, take note and proceed with caution when attempting to hit your target frame.</p>
        <hr />

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">Dex Recommendations &amp; Ability Boosts</span></h6>

        <p>Dex recommendations can be found by opening the Pokedex, when a Pokémon is recommended the encounterslot value for that specific Pokémon is boosted. Storm Drain, Lightning Rod &amp; Harvest abilities will also boost the encounterslot value of Pokémon of the corrisponding type (e.g Harvest boosts grass types).</p>

        <p>Neither of these boosting methods are supported in the RNG tool at this point in time, avoid using them as this will produce inaccurate results.</p>

    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <ol>
            <li>Open SWSH_OWRNG_Generator_GUI, then type your 5 digit TID/SID into the correct fields of the main window (for shiny Pokémon only).</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Open the <code span class="fw-bold">Encounter Lookup</code> sub window, then type the species name of the Pokémon you plan to RNG abuse, select an appealing symbol encounter.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Confirm that the filters have been set properly inside the Main Window, encounter filters can be found on the left-hand side.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Set the correct KO count inside the assigned field on the left, this should match the value displayed by the Pokedex for the Pokémon being hunted.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Set your search filters inside the middle portion of the Main Window. You can filter for specific Marks, IVs, Shininess, etc.</li>
        </ol>

        <blockquote><span class="fw-bold">Example -</span> Encounter Lookup specifies Slippery Slope in overcast weather for Phantump, this information has been automatically filled inside the main window. The KO count for Phantump according to the Pokedex is 500, and the search filters were also manually configured to search for a Shiny with any mark.</blockquote>

<p>Ensure that the encounter and search filters are properly configured before continuing. The advancement methods used to achieve the result are listed in the table found on the main page.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>For Symbol encounters, stand where there is a clear, straight line between you and the area that contains your target Pokémon (patch of grass, cave, etc.). Avoid areas that trigger other Wild/Static spawns. The positioning in Figure 2 is ideal, minimal NPCs, no extra spawned Pokemon, and a clear line between the player and the target spawner.</p>

        <p>Slippery Slope is notably "quiet" in calm weather. Advancement speed is based on location, NPC count, and weather. The more quiet the area, the slower the natural advancements are, and the easier it will be to hit your target frame. Avoid rain or thunderstorm weather as this will create instability due to erratic advancements.</p>

        <blockquote>If you can't find a good spot, knock out any static spawns blocking your path. They will remain despawned until you return to the area after a date change.</blockquote>

        <p>After identifying seeds using the <code span class="fw-bold">Retail Seed Finder</code>, a Shiny Phantump can be found on advance 2016-2020. Target frames can often appear in clusters, which are multiple frames in a row (or close to each other) that produce the same end result.</p>

        <p>Due to having multiple frames that can potentially produce your desired Pokemon, searching for clusters is ideal. You may wish to keep searching for target frames until a cluster appears.</p>

<p>You may need to calculate the rough delay for the encounter. Doing this step will provide the best possible chances of hitting your target frame. Delay is the difference in advancements between spawning the Pokémon in the overworld and the actual frame the Pokémon was generated on.</p>

        <p>If you have been following along you should now be stood in the correct position in-game, have calibrated your NPC count, and know your current seed.</p>

        <h6 span class="fw-bold">Step-by-step:</h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Reidentify the current seed if you have lost track. Click the <code class="fw-bold">Update States</code> button on the main window after doing so.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Open the <code class="fw-bold">Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> sub window, type the number of NPCs into the <code class="fw-bold">NPCs</code> field, then search. Take note of the amount of frames that will be consumed from closing the pause menu (inside the <code class="fw-bold">Jump</code> column).</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Unpause the game, then run into the area that contains your desired target and encounter the first spawned Pokémon, capture it, then use an IV calculator to determine the IVs.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>If the Pokémon encountered does not match your target species, use the <code class="fw-bold">Encounter Lookup</code> to fill in the details of the Pokémon you encountered. Remove any active search filters and enter the correct <code class="fw-bold">KO Count</code> after doing this.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Find the advance that generated the Pokémon in the search results, then subtract the amount of frames that were consumed from the pause menu. This will be the delay for this encounter.</li>
        </ol>

        <blockquote><span class="fw-bold">Example -</span> If the Pokémon was generated on frame 10, and 7 frames were consumed from closing the pause menu, this means the delay for this encounter is 3.</blockquote>

            <li>Subtract the delay from the actual target frame (e.g <code span class="fw-bold">1000 (target) - 3 (delay) = 997</code>) this will set the new target frame and this will be the frame to spawn the Pokémon on.</li>
