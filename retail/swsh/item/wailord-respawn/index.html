    A small guide for respawning the Isle of Armor Wailord.
</small>
<hr />

<p>The enormous <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/item/main-page/wailord.png">Isle of Armor Wailord</a> is visible in the Workout Sea when you first arrive on the Isle of Armor. Once defeated or captured, it does not return normally with date skipping like normal "strong spawns." Instead, the chance of it respawning is 1/100 each fresh day that you first visit the IoA map. Using RNG manipulation, we can respawn the signature IoA Wailord much more easily.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>You will need to date skip so that Isle of Armor considers it a new day. The method you will use depends on if you have the ability to perform Link Battles, either locally or via NSO.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you can activate the PvP date skipping exploit, head to the Isle of Armor, enter the train station, and perform a date skip this way.</li>
                <li>If you cannot use a Link Battle, fly to the train station on IoA, perform a date skip using a nearby Max Raid den, and then walk or bike into the train station without reloading the map.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Now that you are inside the Isle of Armor trains tation, identify your seed and calibrate your menu NPC count; a common NPC value for the train station is 6.</li>
            <li>Save the game.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Wailord has one chance to respawn per day. The check occurs the first time the player enters the Isle of Armor overworld. For this reason, we are required to perform a date skip while standing inside the train station if we have already entered the Isle of Armor overworld for the day. After performing a date skip, we can then save to preserve the new day state.</p>

        <p>If you do not find any results, you will need to increase your search range, change your search filters to be less restrictive, or reset the game for a better seed.</p>

    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>In this example, a frame that will respawn Wailord can be seen in a {% include tooltips/clusters.html %} from advances 50-53. These advances are highlighted yellow, which means that Wailord will respawn if we enter the Isle of Armor main map on any of them for the first time that day.</p>

        <h6 class="fw-bold">Step-by-Step</h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Advance toward your target using <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/overworld/advancing-rng-state/npc-activation.gif">NPC activation</a>,  <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/overworld/advancing-rng-state/menu-close.gif">menu close</a>, or <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/overworld/advancing-rng-state/animations.gif">attack animations</a> depending on how close it is.</li>
            <li>Once you are roughly 100-200 advances before your target, stand close to the train station exit so that holding down on your joystick will cause your character to leave the station and trigger the loading screen.</li>
            <li>Open the <code class="fw-bold">X Menu</code> to pause the game.</li>
            <li>Re-identify your current seed. Click <code class="fw-bold">Update Seeds</code> on the main window of owoow after re-identification, which will send your current seed to the active subwindow.</li>
            <li>Ensure that the <code class="fw-bold">Consider Menu Close?</code> and <code class="fw-bold">Holding Direction?</code> checkboxes are checked in the Wailord Respawn subwindow, and confirm that your NPC count has been entered correctly. Search for your target again.</li>
            <li>From this point, use <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/overworld/advancing-rng-state/animations.gif">attack animations</a> to reach the exact target frame.</li>
            <li>Close the Pok&eacute;mon window so you are on the main <code class="fw-bold">X Menu</code>.</li>
            <li>Hold the left joystick downwards and then unpause the game by pressing B. Release the joystick the moment you see the black loading screen.</li>
            <li>If you did this correctly, the player character should immediately leave the train station and enter the Isle of Armor overworld. You will see that Wailord has been properly respawned.</li>

<p>In Figure 4, we closed the <code class="fw-bold">X Menu</code> on the desired target frame and immediately walked out of the train station to see that Wailord is back in the Isle of Armor.</p>
