<hr />

<p>This page contains information about calibrating your NPC count and using that knowledge to accurately hit target frames. As this technique is frequently used throughout the guide, it is important to develop a solid understanding of how it works.</p>

<p>Closing and reopening the pause menu is a reliable technique used to advance the RNG state in a controlled and predictable manner. Typically, closing the menu also "freezes" natural RNG advancements for 2â€“3 seconds, which makes this method a highly consistent approach for targeting specific frames.</p>

<p>If you have not already done so, you will need to identify your current seed by recording Pokemon 128 animations through either the summary screen or the party menu (summary screen is recommended for seed identification).</p>

<p>If you have already found your current seed, simply re-identify your state by using the <code class="fw-bold">Retail Advances Tracker</code> feature found on the main window. Both initial identification, and re-identification methods are described on the main page if you are unsure how to do this.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold">After you have identified your current seed/state, keep the game paused to avoid unwanted advancements from standing in the overworld.</span></p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 2 -</span> Menu Close Demonstration<p></p>

<p>In Figure 2, the player has closed and re-opened the pause menu, after you have done this, you will need to re-calibrate your current seed once more to find the amount of advances that were consumed from this action.</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 3 -</span> Finding Consumed Advances<p></p>
<img src="./images/menu-close-prediction/finding-consumed-advances.gif" alt="menu-close-prediction-3" class="img-fluid clickable-image" data-image="./images/menu-close-prediction/finding-consumed-advances.gif"><p></p>

<p>In this example, a total of 26 advancements were consumed after re-identifying the current seed, and since 18 advances were consumed through animations, this means that 8 advances were consumed from closing the pause menu.</p>

<p>After observing how many advances were consumed from closing the pause menu, open the <code class="fw-bold">Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> sub-window by selecting it at the top of the main window.</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 4 -</span> Finding NPC Count<p></p>

<p>In Figure 3, the sub-window has been opened which contains our current RNG state. After clicking the search button, a table has appeared. The goal is to tweak the value in the <code class="fw-bold">NPCs</code> field until we see that the first result inside the <code class="fw-bold">Jump</code> column matches the figure observed earlier (in this case, we are tweaking the NPC field until we see +8 in the <code class="fw-bold">Jump</code> column of the table).</p>

<p>After tweaking the value inside the <code class="fw-bold">NPCs</code> field we can see that a +8 jump occurs when searching with 6 NPCs. If everything was done correctly, this should be our current NPC count.</p>

<p>You can repeat this process a few more times to have more confidence that your current NPC count is correct.</p>

    <span class="fw-bold">Great!</span> You should now have a basic understanding of how to calibrate NPC counts, and how to apply that knowledge to accurately hit target frames (you can leave this page open for future reference).
