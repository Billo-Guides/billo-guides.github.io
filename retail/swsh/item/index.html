This portion of the guide will cover the process of RNG abusing the Cram-o-matic and the PC lottery function in Sword/Shield using the SWSH Overworld RNG Generator by <a href="https://github.com/LegoFigure11">LegoFigure11</a>.
Item RNG abuse is best utilized to help players obtain rare/valuable items such as rare Pokeballs!<br /> <br />

<span class="fw-bold">This guide assumes you are using a vanilla Switch console running official stock firmware.</span><br /> <br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Advancing the RNG state:</span></h3>

The RNG state will advance naturally depending on your location, and the amount of NPCs that are present. Since the Cram-o-matic and Rotom PC are located in-doors, we do not need to worry about other variables that would advance the RNG state, like weather.<br /><br />

Multiple in-game actions can also be used to advance the RNG state with varying influence, the most useful actions can be found in the table directly below.<br /><br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Identifying your current seed</span></h3>

The term "motions" or "animations" refers to a feature of the Pokémon summary page, when pressing L3 (Clicking in the left stick) your Pokémon will do one of two animations, physical or special. Recording these in sequence will eventually produce our current RNG state.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 0 -</span> Animation differences<br />
<img src="./images/cram-o-matic/figure-0-animations-retail.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

In the first animation Espeon swipes towards the screen, this is a clear physical animation.<br />
In the second animation Espeon stays in place using a psychic move, this is a clear special animation.<br /><br />

      <span class="fw-bold">How to identify current seeds using the Retail Seed Finder:</span><br /><br />
      <ol>
        <li>Open the <code>Retail Seed Finder</code> window and open the pause menu in-game.</li><br />
        <li>Open the Pokemon party menu, select a Pokemon, then click summary.</li><br />
        <li>Begin making your Pokemon animate by using the <code>L3</code> button, take note of the type of animation. (Physical or special).</li><br />
        <li>If the animation was physical, click the <code>(0)Physical</code> button, if the animation was special, click the <code>(1)Special</code> button.<br /><br />
        If you don't feel like clicking the button, you can use your keyboard too! Simply type <code>0</code> or <code>,</code> for a physical animation, and <code>1</code> or <code>.</code> for a special animation.</li><br />
        <li>Repeat this process 128 times, if done correctly your current seeds will now be visible on-screen. Click <code>Update Main Form</code>. At this stage it is safe to close the Retail Seed Finder window.</li><br />
        <li>After identifying your current seed you can now begin searching for target frames!</li>
      </ol><hr />

      <span class="fw-bold">How to re-identify current seeds using the Retail Advances Tracker:</span><br /><br />
      <ol>
        <li>Click the <code>Generate Pattern</code> button on the main window after identifying your current seed.</li><br />
        <li>Open the Pokemon party menu, select a Pokemon, then click summary.</li><br />
        <li>Record 10-20 animations until you are left with 1 result.</li><br />
        <li>Click <code>Update States</code> after doing so to input your new current seed into the <code>State[0]</code> and <code>Stete[1]</code> fields automatically.</li><br />
        <li>Search for your target frame again and confirm the seed re-identification was correct.</li>
      </ol>

        <summary><span class="fw-bold">Seed Identification Troubleshooting:</span><br /></summary>
      <div class="card-body" class="text-light" style="background-color: #0c0038;">
        If you do not find a result after re-identification, or your target frame disappears, this is because either:<br /><br />
        <ul>
          <li>The initial seed identification (using the <code>Retail Seed Finder</code>) was incorrect. Which is a result of not recording the animations properly.</li>
          <li>The re-identification animations were not recorded properly, and produced an invalid result.</li>
        </ul>
        To resolve this you will need to re-identify your current seed from the start, pay close attention to the sequence of animations to avoid producing incorrect results!<br /><br />

        Seed re-identification plays a big role in advancing towards a target frame, and also helps to find out how many advancements will occur from a specific in-game action.</details>

      </h5>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body" style="background-color: #ffffff36;">
     The <code>Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> can be used to predict the amount of advancements that will pass from closing the pause menu. Closing the pause menu also has an added effect of freezing the RNG state in the area for a a few seconds, this makes it a great option for closing in on any target frames as it provides a lot more consistency in doing so.<br /><br />

     <span class="fw-bold">For Loto-ID and the Cram-o-Matic he NPC Counts are likely as follows:</span><br />
      Wedgehurst Center = 5<br />
      Dojo (Completed IoA Story) = 21<br /><br />

     By knowing how many advancements will occur from closing the pause menu, and having a window of silence to interact with the machine, we can near guarantee to hit any potential target frames.<br /><br />

     When using the <code>Consider menu close</code> feature, the output results are of the frame that you need to close the menu on, <u>NOT</u> the frame that you need to start the interaction on.<br /><br />

    <details>
      <summary><span class="fw-bold">How to calculate the number of NPCs in an area:</span></summary> <br />
      <ol>
        <li>Attempt to count the number of NPCs in the area of your target manually if possible. If this is impossible, starting from 0 NPCs and working forward is acceptable.</li><br />
        <li>Identify your current seeds using the <code>Retail Seed Finder</code>, as explained above, keep the game paused after doing so. This will ensure that the amount of advancements that have occured since finding your seed will remain at 0.</li><br />
        <li>Click the <code>Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> button at the top of the generator to open a smaller window.</li><br />
        <li>Take your seeds from the <code>State[0] & State[1]</code> fields of the Main Window, and enter them into the same fields of the Menu Close Advances Viewer window.</li><br />
        <li>Take the number of NPCs you counted earlier and put it into the <code>NPCs</code> field.</li><br />
        <li>Enter your number of advancements into the <code>Init Adv.</code> field. If the above steps were closely followed, this number should be 0.</li><br />
        <li>Enter the search range into the <code>+</code> field, then hit search, you should then close and reopen the menu and re-identify your current seed.</li><br />
        <li>Subtract the amount of advancements that were consumed by re-identifying your current seed from the total amount of advancements that have occured. (For example, if 18 advancements have occured, and it took 14 advancements to re-identify the current seed, then 4 frames passed from opening and closing the pause menu)</li><br />
        <li>If the values do not match, tweak the number in the NPCs field until it matches. (Decrease the value if the number of advances you got was lower than expected, increase if it was higher)</li>

<hr />

The goal is to interact with the Cram-o-matic on the calculated target frame given to us by the <code>Cram-o-matic</code> window of the generator. We will be using the advancement methods listed in the table above to hit the target frame.<br /><br />

In this example we will be aiming for a 5 Level Balls. You can be more specific with the filters if you wish, such as filtering for a specific rare items.<br /><br />

First, stand near the Cram-o-matic and pause the game, then begin recording animations to identify your current seed.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 1 -</span> Tool setup:<br />
<img src="./images/cram-o-matic/figure-1-cram-retail-seedfinder.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

      We are now stood directly next to the Cram-o-matic and have the console connected to the generator.<br /><br />

      Once the player interacts with the Cram-o-matic, the RNG state will freeze due to being on a menu screen. This is why it is only important to interact with the Cram-o-matic on the correct frame.<br /><br />

      Once the <code>Cram-o-matic</code> tab is filled in correctly, you can begin looking for target frames by clicking the search button.<br /><br />

      <span class="fw-bold">If your results are not desirable, restart the game and re-identify your current seed, then search for a new target frame.</span><br /><br />

        <li>Advance towards your target frame using any of the methods listed inside the <a href="#AdvancementTable">table above</a>.</li><br />

        <li>Gradually re-identify your current seed, to avoid overshooting any target frames.</li><br />
      
        <li>Once you are within a few hundred frames of your target, stand within distance of the Cram-o-matic so that you can immediately interact with it in a single <code>A</code> press.</li><br />

          <span class="fw-bold">Tip:</span> From this point it's recommended to only advance using <code>menu close & animations</code> as they only advance in small increments, making them easy to keep track of.

        <div class="card-body" class="text-light" style="background-color: #0c0038;">
          <span class="fw-bold">Tip:</span> If you are unable to find your target frame in the search results, this means the target cannot be hit based on your seed. Use animations to advance the RNG state slightly, re-identify your current seed again, then close and re-open the <code>Cram-o-matic</code> window and search for your target frame again. Repeat this process until your target frame is visible.
       </div><br />

        <li>Open and close the pause menu until closing the menu a single time lands onto your target frame, according to the <code>Cram-o-matic</code> window prediction.</li><br />
      
        <li>Close the pause menu and quickly interact with the Cram-o-matic, if you believe you hit your target frame, feed it the appropriate apricorns to claim your reward.</li><br />
      
      <div class="card-body" class="text-light" style="background-color: #0c0038;">
       You can be creative with the methods you use to advance the RNG state. Menu close prediction is not necessary but will make for a much easier time hitting target frames and is extremely helpful in areas of the game where the RNG advances at a quick pace.
