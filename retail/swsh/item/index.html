<p>SWSH_OWRNG_Generator_GUI tracks the current RNG state and the number of advancements since connecting to the program. The RNG state advances naturally based on your location, the weather, and the number of NPCs present or active.</p>

<p>Different in-game actions can also be used to advance the RNG state with varying influence, the most useful actions can be found in the table directly below.</p>

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">How to Date Skip</span></h6>
    <p>Date-skipping on retail hardware is a manual process that requires some initial setup, there are two methods you can use, the faster method requires a Nintendo Switch Online subscription or multiple consoles/games, while the slower method does not.</p>
    
    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Fast Method</span></h6>
    <ol>
      <li>Enter an online single or double battle, you can search without a code for quicker wait times.</li>
      <li>Enter airplane mode once you enter the battle. Alternatively you can play out the whole battle if you wish.</li>
      <li>From here navigate to the System Settings and change the date ahead by one day.</li>
      <li>Exit back to the main menu of the home screen and reopen the game.</li>
      <li>You should notice time-based events such as the Rotom Lottery function have reset and that the weather in the Wild Areas has changed.</li>
      <li>From here you can date-skip easily by repeating step 3. This exploit needs to be re-activated every time the game is reset.</li>

  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <h6><span class="fw-bold">What are motions/animations?</span></h6>
        
    <p>This refers to an in-game feature on the Pokémon summary screen or party menu. Pressing <code span class="fw-bold">L3 (pressing the left stick)</code> will cause your Pokémon to perform one of 2 animations, these will be referred to as "physical" and "special" animations.</p>
    
    <p>In the above image, we can see Espeon performing 2 different types of animation.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>In the first animation we can see Espeon lunging towards the screen, this is clearly Espeons physical animation.</li>
      <li>In the second animation we can see Espeon standing in place using telekinesis, this is clearly Espeons special animation.</li>

  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>The Retail Seed Finder subwindow is where players can calculate their current seed, this is done by recording a sequence of 128 motions/animations in a row.</p>
          
    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Initial Seed Finding Instructions</span></h6>
      <ol>
        <li>Open the pause menu in-game, then open the <code span class="fw-bold">Retail Seed Finder</code> subwindow on SwSh OWRNG Generator GUI.</li>
        <li>Open the party menu, select the Pokémon you will use to record animations, then click <code span class="fw-bold">Summary</code>.</li>
        <li>Use the <code span class="fw-bold">L3</code> button to cause an animation, take note of if the animation was physical or special.</li>
        <li>If the animation was physical, press the <code span class="fw-bold">(0) Physical</code> button. If the animation was special, press the <code span class="fw-bold">(1) Special</code> button.</li>
        <li>Repeat this process 128 times in a row and a seed will be produced. Click the <code span class="fw-bold">Update Main Form</code> button to paste it into the main window.</li>
        <li>If a seed was not produced this indicates that the animations were not recorded properly, try again.</li>
      </ol>

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Seed Re-identification</span></h6>
    <p>Re-identifying your current seed is done using the Retail Advances Tracker feature of the Main Window, and is essentially a simplified version of finding your seed using animations.</p>
    
      <ol>
        <li>Click the <code span class="fw-bold">Generate Pattern</code> button after initially identifying your seed.</li>
        <li>Record a sequence of 8-20 animations using the above mentioned method, the amount can vary but should be relatively quick.</li>
        <li>Once a seed has been produced, click the <code span class="fw-bold">Update States</code> button to paste your current seed into the top-left of the main window.</li>
      </ol>

    <blockquote>Recording animations through the Pokémon summary screen is recommended, this is due to the party menu advancing +1 per button clicked, the summary screen advances +1 per animation, making it easier to keep track of.</blockquote>

  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>The Menu Close Advances Viewer sub window (pictured above), predicts the number of advancements from closing the pause menu. This advancement method is recommended as closing the pause menu freezes the RNG state for a few seconds, making it an extremely consistent method of hitting an exact target frame.</p>
      
    <p>After entering your seeds and hitting search, a table will appear. The <code class="fw-bold">Jump</code> column of the table displays the amount of advancements that will occur from closing the pause menu, this number varies based on the amount of NPCs in your area, so it is important to calibrate your NPC count when attempting to use menu close prediction.</p>

    <details>
      <summary><span class="fw-bold">Likely NPC Counts</span></summary>
      <ul>
      <li>Wedgehurst Pokemon Center (Loto) = 5 NPCs</li>
      <li>Isle of Armor Dojo (Cram-o-Matic)= 21 NPCs with completed story</li>
      <li>Snowslide Slope (Watt Trader)= 1-2 NPCs, requires calibration</li>
    </ul>
    </details><hr />

    <h6 span class="fw-bold">How to Calibrate NPC Count</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Use <code span class="fw-bold">Retail Seed Finder</code> to identify your current seed, make sure to click <code span class="fw-bold">Update Main Form</code> button after doing so.</li><p></p>
        <li>Close the pause menu once and quickly re-open it, this will advance the RNG state. From here you will need to re-identify your current seed using the above method.</li><p></p>
        <li>Take note of the amount of the total amount of advancements that have occured from re-identifying your seed, then subtract the amount of animations were consumed from re-identification.</li>
      </ul>

    <blockquote><span class="fw-bold">Example -</span> If a total of 15 advancements occured from seed re-identification, and only 8 advancements were consumed from animations, a total of 7 advancements occured from closing the pause menu.</blockquote>
    
      <ul>
        <li>Without clicking the <code span class="fw-bold">Update States</code> button, open the <code span class="fw-bold">Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> sub window, make sure the seeds inside the window match the top left of the main window.</li><p></p>
        <li>Search using the suggested NPCs listed above, If the number inside the <code class="fw-bold">Jump</code> column does not match, increase or decrease the number of NPCs by 1 until everything aligns properly with what is expected.</li><p></p>
        <li>In this example, we expect to see +7 in the <code class="fw-bold">Jump</code> column, so we would gradually alter the NPC value until +7 appears to get the correct NPC count.</li>
      </ul>

    <blockquote>We highly recommend becoming familiar with NPC count calibration before continuing with the guide. This method is used in almost all cases as it provides the most consistency.</blockquote>

<p><span class="fw-bold">We found a target frame!</span> a Master Ball on advance 52. This will be the frame we close the pause menu and interact with the PC, as we are using the <code class="fw-bold">Consider menu close</code> feature.</p>

<p>First you will need to calibrate the amount of NPCs in the area.

<p>The result matches the output given by the <code class="fw-bold">Loto-ID</code> sub window, mission accomplished! We got a Master Ball from the lottery machine on the first attempt!</p>

<p>The goal is to interact with the Watt Trader in Snowslide Slope on the calculated target frame given to us by the <code class="fw-bold">Watt Trader</code> window of the generator, we will be using the advancement methods listed in the table above to hit the target frame, most notably, menu close, animations & date skipping.</p>

<p>In this example we will be aiming for a Dream Ball or Beast Ball, as these are the most valuable items that this trader has to offer.</p>

  <div class="anchored card-header" style="background-color: #0c0038;" id="required-setup-watt-trader-retail">
    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Required Setup</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Before starting, stock up on enough PokeWatts to buy the rare balls from the trader, you will need 40,000 Watts per ball. Also unlock the Snowslide Slope fly point if you have not already done so by talking to the Watt Trader.</p>

    <p>Now you will need to put your game in a specific state by following these instructions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Fly into Snowslide Slope, or move far enough away from the NPC so that he is no longer looking at the player.</li><p></p>
      <li>Activate the fast date skipping method (NSO subscribers), or use the slow method by visiting a raid (no NSO) - <a href="#date-skipping-options-retail">Tutorial</a>.</li><p></p>
      <li>Perform a date skip to reset time based events, you can confirm a skip has been performed based on the area weather.</li><p></p>
      <li>It may take 2-3 skips to confirm a weather change, if the weather does not change then you are doing something incorrectly.</li><p></p>
      <li>Once you have confirmed that your date skipping method works you can pause the game and save.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote><p>The Watt Trader NPCs items are locked in upon speaking to him for the first time during any day, this is why resetting time based events is important for hitting the correct target frame.</p>
      You can save the game upon resetting time based events to preserve the correct NPC state, but this means you will need to reset the game after a failed attempt, and re-activate the fast date skipping exploit if used.</blockquote>

<p>Observing the above image, we can see that interacting with the Watt Trader using the above method does not cause the RNG state to rapidly advance (see the <code class="fw-bold">Curr Adv.</code> field on the bottom-left), but if we do not interact with the NPC quick enough...</p>

<p>We can now see advancements are occuring at an almost uncontrollable rate. So you will need to interact with the Watt Trader quickly (as demonstrated in Figure 1) as the rapid advancements will cause you to miss your target frame.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #b60606;">Disclaimer -</span> The advancement rate was observed using Custom Firmware for the sake of demonstration, the rest of this guide is focused on using pure retail hardware.</p>
