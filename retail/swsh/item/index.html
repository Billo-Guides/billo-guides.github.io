</div><hr />

<p>SWSH_OWRNG_Generator_GUI can be used to track the current RNG state, and the amount of advancements that have passed since idenfiying your current seed using the program. Frames will advance naturally depending on your location and the amount of NPCs that are present. Since both machines are located in-doors, these are the only variables that we need to consider.</p>
  
<p>Different in-game actions can also be used to advance the RNG state with varying influence, the most useful actions can be found in the table directly below.</p>

    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Retail Seed Identification & Re-identification:</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>The term "motions" or "animations" refers to a feature of the Pokémon summary page, when pressing the <code class="fw-bold">L3</code> button (clicking the left stick) your Pokémon will do one of two animations, physical or special. Recording these in sequence will eventually produce our current RNG state.</p><hr />

    <h5 class="fw-bold">Identifying Your Current Seed:</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the <code class="fw-bold">Retail Seed Finder</code> window and open press the <code class="fw-bold">X</code> button to pause the game.</li>
      <li>Open the party menu, select a Pokemon, then click <code class="fw-bold">Summary</code>.</li>
      <li>Perform an animation advance by pressing the <code class="fw-bold">L3</code> button, take note of if the animation was physical or special.</li>
      <li>If the animation was physical, click the <code class="fw-bold">(0)Physical</code> button, if the animation was special, click the <code class="fw-bold">(1)Special</code> button.</li>
      <li>Repeat this process 128 times, if done correctly your current seeds will now be visible on-screen. Click <code class="fw-bold">Update Main Form</code>.</li>
      <li>At this stage it is safe to close the <code class="fw-bold">Retail Seed Finder</code> window.</li>
      <li>Now your calculated current seed will be present in the Main Window, and you can begin searching for target frames!</li>
    </ol><hr />

    <h5 class="fw-bold">Re-identifying Your Current Seed:</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>Click the <code class="fw-bold">Generate Pattern</code> button on the main window after identifying your seed.</li>
      <li>Open the party menu, select a Pokemon, then click <code class="fw-bold">Summary</code>.</li>
      <li>Record 10-20 animations until you are left with 1 result. This is your new current seed.</li>
      <li>Click <code class="fw-bold">Update States</code>, this will update your seed in the Main Window automatically.</li>
      <li>Search for your target frame again and confirm the seed re-identification was correct.</li>
    </ol><hr />

    <details>
      <summary><span class="fw-bold">Troubleshooting:</span></summary>
      <p>If you do not find a result after re-identification, or your target frame disappears, this is because either:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The initial seed identification (using the <code class="fw-bold">Retail Seed Finder</code>) was incorrect. Which is a result of not recording the animations properly.</li>
        <li>The re-identification animations were not recorded properly, and produced an invalid result.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To resolve this you will need to re-identify your current seed from the start, pay close attention to the sequence of animations to avoid producing incorrect results!</p>

      <p>Seed re-identification plays a big role in advancing towards a target frame, and also helps to find out how many advancements will occur from a specific in-game action.</p>
    </details>
 </div>
</div><br />

<p><span class="fw-bold">If your results are not desirable, you will need to reset the game and identify your current seeds again.</span></p>

    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Menu Close Advancement Prediction:</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>The <code class="fw-bold">Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> window can be used to predict the amount of advancements that will pass from closing the pause menu. Closing the pause menu also has an added effect of freezing the RNG state in the area for a a few seconds, this makes it a great option for closing in on any target frames as it provides a lot more consistency in doing so.</p>

    <p><span class="fw-bold">For Loto-ID and the Cram-o-Matic the NPC Counts are likely as follows:</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Wedgehurst Pokemon Center = 5 NPCs</li>
      <li>Isle of Armor Dojo = 21 NPCs with completed story</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you have a different progression level, you will need to count the number of NPCs manually. If this is impossible you will need to start from 0 and work upwards until you find the correct NPC count.</p>

    <p>By knowing how many advancements will occur from closing the pause menu, and having a window of silence to interact with the machine, we can near guarantee to hit any potential target frames.</p>

    <p>When using the <code class="fw-bold">Consider menu close</code> feature of the <code class="fw-bold">Menu Close Advances Viewer</code>, the result output will be for the frame you should close the pause menu on, not the frame of which you should interact with the machine!</p>

    <details>
      <summary><span class="fw-bold">Manually Calculating NPC Count:</span></summary>
      <ol>
        <li>Pause the game with the <code class="fw-bold">X</code> button, then identify your current seeds using the <code class="fw-bold">Retail Seed Finder</code>, <u>keep the game paused while doing so</u>.</li>
        <li>Click the <code class="fw-bold">Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> button to open a smaller window, then copy your seeds from the main window into the correct fields of this window.</li>
        <li>Enter your number of advancements into the <code class="fw-bold">Init Adv.</code> field. If the above steps were closely followed, this number should be 0.</li>
        <li>Enter the search range into the <code class="fw-bold">+</code> field, then hit search, then quickly close and reopen the pause menu.</li>
        <li>Re-identify your current seed to work out how many advancements have passed from closing and opening the pause menu.</li>
        <li>Subtract the amount of advancements that were consumed by re-identifying your current seed from the total amount of advancements that have occured.</li>
        <li>If the values do not match what the <code class="fw-bold">Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> expects, tweak the number inside the NPCs field by +1 until you get a match.</li>
      </ol>

      <div class="alert" style="background-color: #c0bdbd;">
        <span class="fw-bold">Example -</span> If 18 advancements have occured from closing the pause menu and re-identifying the seed, and it took 14 advancements to re-identify, then 4 frames passed from opening and closing the pause menu.

<p>In this example we will be aiming for a 5 Level Balls. You can be more specific with the filters if you wish, such as filtering for a specific rare items.</p>
