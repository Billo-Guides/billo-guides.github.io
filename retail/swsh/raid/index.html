</div><hr />

<p>This guide provides in-depth coverage of how to use PokeFinder by AdmiralFish to RNG abuse Max Raid Battles in Sword/Shield. Using raid RNG abuse you can predict the internal values of upcoming raids (IVs, Nature, Shiny Status etc.) and filter for desirable results.</p>

<p>Each raid is given a randomly assigned "den seed", this seed is used to determine which Pokemon will be inside a den. Every day that passes will increment the den seed by 1 in a predictable manner, making Raid RNG abuse entirely possible using a process known as "date skipping". Simply skip the required amount to reach your desired seed.</p>
  
<p><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #b60606;">From here it is assumed you are using an unmodified Switch console.</span></p>

  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Pictured above is the window you will be presented with after opening the Gen 8 Raid section of PokeFinder for the first time. For the purposes of this guide, this window will be referred to as the "main" window. Here is where we can calculate upcoming target frames based on our search parameters.</p>

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Feature Overview:</span></h6>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="fw-bold">Left Side -</span> Enter search conditions, select a specific raid, and input seed and # of advances.</li>
      <li><span class="fw-bold">Center -</span> Specify raid details, such as species, raid type (common/rare), and difficulty (star level).</li>
      <li><span class="fw-bold">Right Side -</span> Search filter details, filter for high IV, specific nature, and/or shiny target frames.</li>
      <li><span class="fw-bold">Top -</span> Profile management, enter your 5 digit IDs & trainer information from your save file here.</li>
      <li><span class="fw-bold">Bottom -</span> Search result output, any result that matches your filters will be displayed here.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Upon opening PokeFinder, prior to opening the main Window, a smaller window is available on screen to select the type of RNG abuse you wish to do. There are small tabs across the top of this window, one of them is labeled <code span class="fw-bold">Gen 8 Tools</code>.</p>

    <p>In the <code span class="fw-bold">Gen 8 Tools</code> dropdown menu, select <code span class="fw-bold">Den Map</code>, this will open a sub window containing a map of each of the wild areas. Here you can select any Den and find it's rough location on the map, indicated by the red circle icon on the map display.</p>

    <p>Matching your in-game Raid Den with the Den ID of PokeFinder can be a long or confusing process, so we can take advantage of this feature to more easily narrow down the Den ID we need. This will be visualized later on in the guide.</p>

    <p>Showing a Pokemon caught from a Max Raid Battle to a SysBot will produce a "Raid seed", (as pictured in Figure 2), this is what PokeFinder uses to predict upcoming advancements.</p>

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Step-by-step:</span></h6>
    <ol>
      <li>Throw a Wishing Piece into the den you wish to seed check.</li>
      <li>Capture the Pokemon from the raid, DO NOT SAVE AFTER THIS POINT.</li>
      <li>Navigate to the server that contains the SysBot, enter the channel for inputting commands.</li>
      <li>Initiate a <code span class="fw-bold">seedcheck</code> trade (command syntax may vary between hosts).</li>
      <li>Wait for the bot to message you a trade code, then meet with it in-game.</li>
      <li>Show the bot the caught Pokemon and wait for it to message you a den seed.</li>
      <li>Reset the game, you should now be back at the active den and also have your den seed.</li>
    </ol>

    <blockquote>There are methods to aquire your seed without the use of SysBot or Custom Firmware at all, but this is an unnecessarily lengthy process that will not be covered in this guide.

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Setting Correct Filters:</span></h6>
    <ul>
      <li>Using the <code span class="fw-bold">Gen 8 Tools -> Den Map</code> feature of PokeFinder, locate the den you are currently standing at in-game, take note of the ID after doing so.</li>

    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Den Finding & Search Filters</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Before anything else, you will need to pick the Den or Pokemon you wish to RNG abuse in. This is best achieved using an online resource, such as the <a href="https://www.serebii.net/swordshield/maxraidbattledens.shtml">Serebii.net Raid Encounter Tables</a></p>

    <p>Navigate to the location of your desired Raid Den in game, defeat the raid if there is a Pokemon inside, then throw in a Wishing Piece, this will save the game. You will now need to match the in-game den with the corrisponding Den ID in PokeFinder. An example of how to do this can be seen in the above image.</p>

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Finding the Den ID:</span></h6>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the <code span class="fw-bold">Den Map</code> found in the <code span class="fw-bold">Gen 8 Tools</code> dropdown menu of PokeFinder.</li>
      <li>Select the map that corrisponds to the map which contains your desired Pokemon (Wild Area | IoA | CT).</li>
      <li>Select different Den IDs until you find one in the rough location of where you are standing in-game.</li>
      <li>Select the Den ID in the PokeFinder main window and confirm the species match on PokeFinder and in-game.</li>
    </ol>

    <blockquote>If your den is from a promotional event distribution, select <code span class="fw-bold">Event</code> in the <code span class="fw-bold">Location</code> dropdown menu on the left, then select the exact distribution in the dropdown directly below. You do not need to track your Raid Den location for event distributions.</blockquote>

  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p><span class="fw-bold">Target frame found!</span> in Figure 5 we can see that a Shiny, Adamant natured Bewear has been found in 78 advancements, and that the den we are searching in has a common (RED) beam. It is now time to begin advancing towards the target.</p>

    <p>Frames are advanced by 1 per day that has passed, which means we will need to advance 78 days to hit our target shiny frame. We can trick the game into thinking a day has passed using the date skipping exploit.</p>

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">How to date skip:</span></h6>
    <p>Date-skipping on retail hardware is a manual process that requires some initial setup, there are two methods you can use, the faster method requires a Nintendo Switch Online subscription or multiple consoles/games, while the slower method does not.</p>

    <p>Use one of the below methods to advance towards your target frame, try to keep track of the rough amount of advancements you have done so far. You can use SysBot to check your current seed once you are closer to your target frame.</p>

    <details open>
    <summary><span class="fw-bold">Fast method:</span></summary>
    <ol>
      <li>Enter an online single or double battle, you can search without a code for quicker wait times.</li>
      <li>Enter airplane mode once you enter the battle. Alternatively you can play out the whole battle if you wish.</li>
      <li>From here navigate to the System Settings and change the date ahead by one day, then re-open the game.</li>
      <li>If done correctly your raid should now give off Watts again, as if you have not interacted with it in the first place.</li>
      <li>From here you can date-skip easily by repeating step 3. This exploit needs to be re-activated every time the game is reset.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If your target is >1000 advancements away and you intend to use the fast method, it is recommended to re-locate to an indoor location to do your advancements to avoid crashing the game.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary><span class="fw-bold">Slow method:</span></summary>
      <ol>
        <li>Find an active Max Raid, interact with it, then click "Invite Others".</li>
        <li>From here navigate to the System Settings and change the date ahead by one day.</li>
        <li>Exit back to the main menu of the home screen and reopen the game.</li>
        <li>If done correctly your raid should now give off Watts again, as if you have not interacted with it in the first place.</li>  
        <li>To repeat this process you will need to start again from step 1.</li>
      </ol>
    </details>

    <blockquote><span class="fw-bold">Note -</span> If you wish to manipulate the species inside the den you must save 3 advancements (or date skips) away from your target! The first 2 days are locked onto a specific species and the third one is decided at random.</blockquote>

    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Species Manipulation (The "3 Day" Method)</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>At this stage you should be exactly 3 frames/advances/days away from your target (today(0), second day(1), third day(2), target day(3)), from here you can manipulate the species on the "target day".</p>

    <p>In the above image, we saved 3 frames away from the target and advanced the seed 3 times, but the species is incorrect, this problem can be corrected by doing the following:</p>

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Species Manipulation Tutorial:</span></h6>
    <ol>
      <li>First, save the game once you are confident that you are 3 frames away from your target den.</li>
      <li>Advance 3 days, then enter the raid to confirm that it is what you expect (check if shiny, capture if specific stats and non shiny).</li>
      <li>Reset the game and re-enter the overworld, you should now be stood back at your raid den, 3 advanced away from the target.</li>
      <li>Advance 3 days, you should now see that the species has changed, repeat this step until your desired species appears.</li>
      <li>Save once you hit your desired species if you wish to share the raid with others!</li>
    </ol>

    <blockquote>If you're unsure whether you've hit the correct frame or species, especially when targeting a shiny Pokémon, you can enter the raid and intentionally lose. This allows you to verify that the Pokémon matches your expectations before saving the game.</blockquote>

<a href="raid/images/figure-7-result-found.gif" target="_blank"><img src="raid/images/figure-7-result-found.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"></a><br /><br />

<p>The den now contains the desired species, in this case, a 5 star Bewear species! We can now capture the Pokemon or share the raid with friends.</p>

<p>When sharing the raid with friends, ensure the System Time does not pass 00:00 (Midnight) as this will cause the seed to advance naturally. Since you should be saved on a raid, you can simply change the date back to the date you saved on to preserve the current seed and share the raid across multiple days.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold">That's all there is to manipulating Max Raid Battles on retail hardware!</span>
