    Understanding the common methods used to advance the RNG state.
</small>
<hr />

<p>RNG advancements can occur naturally based on the overworld environment, or they can be forced by performing specific actions.</p>

<p>Opening the in-game pause menu with the <code span class="fw-bold">X</code> button pauses RNG advances. This is especially convenient since we use the Pokemon menu to re-identify the seed and precisely go through the last few advances before the RNG manipulation attempt. You can always open the menu if you need a moment to verify where you are.</p>

<p>Be aware that date skipping in the menu will cause a single day's advances to occur when the menu is closed, and changing the weather to or away from Rain/Thunderstorm weather can cause additional advances when clicking the buttons on this menu.</p>

<p>The most useful actions to advance the RNG state are listed in the table below.</p>

<table class="table table-striped" style="width:100%" id="overworld-rng-table">

    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>With the Pok&eacute;mon party list open, pressing down on the <code span class="fw-bold">Left Stick</code>/<code span class="fw-bold">Right Stick</code> causes the RNG state to advance by +1 with each press. This works similarly in the Pok&eacute;mon summary, but you must wait for each animation to play completely. To advance quickly, using the party list is recommended since it is possible to press the sticks rapidly without having to wait for animations.</p>

        <p>If you are performing your RNG manipulation in Rain/Thunderstorm, you should be doing your final advances on the party list menu. This is because backing out of the summary screen adds extra rain advances that are not predicted by owoow.</p>

        <p>Once you click the stick on a frame, you are on the next frame. For example, if you want to advance from frame 0 to frame 3, you would click 3 times to get from 0 to 1, then 1 to 2, then 2 to 3. You would not click the stick at all on frame 3 because this will consume that RNG state which you wanted for your Pok&eacute;mon.</p>

        <h6 span class="fw-bold">Use Cases</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>Advancing in a predictable manner to reach a specific RNG state/advance (~1-300 advancements away).</li>

    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>Closing the pause menu advances the RNG state in a predictable manner based on the current number of NPCs in the area and the current weather. In most cases, closing the pause menu freezes advances for a short period of time, making this method ideal for hitting a target frame.</p>
        <p>Due to the effectiveness of this method, menu close prediction will be referenced often throughout this guide. How to calibrate NPC counts will be explained later.</p>

        <h6 span class="fw-bold">Use Cases</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>Opening and closing the in-game menu can be used to advance the RNG state without movement (~100-500 advancements away).

    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>Mounting and dismounting the bike advances the RNG state by a small amount. The exact number of advances consumed from this action is variable, and depends on the number of NPCs currently in the area and number of Pok&eacute;mon in your party.</p>

        <p>Why does having more Pok&eacute;mon cause more advancements? When you get on a bike, the game attempts to set the bike memory to Pok&eacute;mon in your party. If they already have a bike memory, then the check does not occur, and you will experience fewer advances. The bike memory should look like "Calyrex rode a bike with Billo on a seaside road." Memory intensity does not matter.</p>

        <p>Keep in mind that using this method in front of activated NPCs will paradoxically cause advancements to be slower since the NPC advancements do not resume until the bike animation is done.</p>

        <h6 span class="fw-bold">Use Cases</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>Used to advance short distances quickly to avoid overshooting (~100-500 advancements away).</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Some example numbers: Bike hopping with 6 Pok&eacute;mon in party at the Max Lair is about 450 advances per minute, while doing the same at the Dojo with 24 menu NPCs gives about 3000 per minute.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Should not be used right before biking towards the target as it is very variable and unpredictable.</li>

        <p>Changing the weather to, or moving into an area with Rain/Thunderstorm causes the RNG state to advance rapidly. These rapid advances will continue until the weather in the area changes or the player moves to a different area where it is no longer raining.</p>

        <p>If the weather is changed to Rain/Thunderstorm while the in-game pause menu is up, you will not start experiencing wet weather menu advancments until you have interacting with menus for a while.</p>

        <p>If the weather is changed away from Rain/Thunderstorm while the in-game pause menu is up, you will continue to experience wet weather menu advancments the first few times you interact with menus.

        <p>Another way to ensure that the weather has updated in the overworld is to stop earlier and briefly close the menu to the overworld so the weather changes over completely.</p>

        <p>Using the PvP date skipping exploit to advance the RNG state rapidly. The number of advancements consumed per day skipped varies based on the number of Pok&eacute;mon currently stored in boxes (excluding eggs). With optimal box management, it is possible to consume upwards of 16,000 advances per day skipped.</p>

        <p><code span class="fw-bold">target frame / number of advances per day skipped = number of days to skip</code></p>

        <p>There are two versions of this exploit that can be used based on your setup. One requires partipating in a PvP battle, and the other requires interacting with a raid.</p>

        <h6 span class="fw-bold">PvP Exploit (Recommended)</h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the game and enter any Wild Area. Position your camera so you can see some active raid beams or claim the Watts from a nearby raid den.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Open the Y-Comm, connect to the internet, and select the <code span class="fw-bold">Link Battle</code> option.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Search for a battle with no code to find an online battle as quickly as possible.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Once you have entered the battle, cancel the battle by turning on <code span class="fw-bold">Airplane Mode</code>.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Close any in-game menus and go back to the overworld.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>It is possible to skip multiple days at once without resuming the game. To do this, setting the date forward, hit <code span class="fw-bold">OK</code>, and repeat this process until you have done enough days. You can only skip once each time you hit <code span class="fw-bold">OK</code>, so changing the date forward by more than 1 will still be treated as 1.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>If you are in the Wild Area, resuming the game after advancing multiple days has a chance to crash your game! If you are advancing more than 1 month at a time, we suggest you move indoors to a Pok&eacute;mon Center.</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <li>If you did this correctly, the screen will flash, the currently active raid beams will change location, and any Watts you claimed will become available again.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Navigate to an indoor location when skipping >1000 days to avoid crashing the game.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Repeat this process from step 4. The exploit remains active until the game is restarted.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><small>Technically, you can activate the exploit without connecting online. This requires communicating in a local battle, which means you will need to have 2 Switches and 2 copies of Sword/Shield.</small></p>

        <p>It is possible to disable the PvP exploit in-game if you no longer want it to be active and you do not want to lose track of your current RNG state by resetting.</p>

        <h6 span class="fw-bold">Canceling PvP Exploit with Raid Invite</h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Enter any Wild Area and find any active raid den.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Start the raid and click <code span class="fw-bold">Invite Others</code>.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><code span class="fw-bold">Quit</code> the raid.</li>
        </ol>

        <h6 span class="fw-bold">Raid Exploit (Slower)</h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the game, enter any Wild Area and find an inactive raid den.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Throw a Wishing Piece into the raid den, then interact with it.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Click <code span class="fw-bold">Invite Others</code>, then minimize the game by pressing the Home button.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Navigate to <code span class="fw-bold">System Settings</code>. Change the console date forward under <code span class="fw-bold">System</code>, then resume the game.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Back out of the raid and re-enter the overworld.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>If you did this correctly, you should see that you are able to claim Watts from the raid den again.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Repeat this process from Step 3 onwards as much as needed.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><small>This exploit is much slower than the PvP exploit. Players should only use this method if they do not have NSO or access to a second console/game to communicate locally.</small></p>

        <p>For the purposes of this guide, "date skipping" refers to using one of these RNG advancement methods, and "changing the date" means to change the system clock manually without triggering a midnight reset. If no exploits are active, it is fine to change the system date to anything you wish without triggering a date skip. If the PvP exploit is active, you can only change the date backwards without triggering a date skip.</p>

        <h6 span class="fw-bold">Use Cases</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>Used to advance large distances, best suited when advancing towards very rare targets (~30,000-advancements away).</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>You can calculate the required number of skips needed to reach a target frame.</li>
        </ul>

    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>Figure 9 illustrates the combination of three advancement techniques: wet weather, NPC activation, and bike bell usage. These methods collectively advance the RNG state rapidly without relying on date skipping.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Wet Weather -</span> Causes the RNG state to advance rapidly on its own. Simply change the date to one where the weather is Rain/Thunderstorm and stand in the overworld.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">NPC Activation -</span> Standing close enough to an NPC to "activate" them further increases the RNG advancement rate.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Bike Bell/Whistling -</span> Ringing the bike bell (or player whistling) introduces additional advancements. While effective, this requires some manual input.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If done correctly, you should see that the NPC is facing the player, meaning they are now "active", and each time the player rings the bike bell or whistles, the NPC will blink (see the above image for a demonstration of this).</p>

        <h6 span class="fw-bold">Examples</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>Standing next to <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/overworld/advancing-rng-state/ioa-diglett-npc.png">this NPC and his Diglett</a> in the IOA, while standing in Thunderstorm weather and ringing the bike bell, advances roughly 17,000 frames per minute.</li>
