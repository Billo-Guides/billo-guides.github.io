        <p>On the far right of the main window, locate the button for the <code span class="fw-bold">Retail Seed Finder</code>, clicking it will open the sub-window displayed in Figure 1. This is where we will record a series of actions known as "motions" or "animations" to identify our current seed.</p>

        <h6 span class="fw-bold">What are motions/animations?</h6>
        <p>When on the summary screen of a Pok&eacute;mon, pressing down on the <code span class="fw-bold">Left/Right Stick</code> will cause the Pok&eacute;mon to perform an attack animation. Most Pok&eacute;mon have two separate attack animations, which can be referred to as "Physical" or "Special". <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/retail/swsh/overworld/seed-calibration/animations.gif">this gif</a> provides a short demonstration on how to identify animation differences.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>When Espeon lunges at the screen, this is a physical animation.</li>
            <li>When Espeon stands in place, this is a special animation.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It is important to pick a Pok&eacute;mon that has a clear animation difference to make the process as simple as possible. Espeon, Gallade, Drilbur, and Metapod are the most commonly used Pok&eacute;mon for this process.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>To determine your seed, you will need to accurately record 128 consecutive attack animations. You can do this on either the Pok&eacute;mon summary screen or the party list.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>If you are new to the process, we recommend that you use the Pok&eacute;mon summary screen! The party list allows you to press the stick before the previous animation has finished, which will cause an RNG advancement that you cannot see.</li>
        </ol>

        <h6 span class="fw-bold">Step-by-Step</h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to either the Pok&eacute;mon summary screen or the party list, depending on whether you are familiar with the process.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Make your Pok&eacute;mon animate by pressing down on the <code span class="fw-bold">Left Stick</code>/<code span class="fw-bold">Right Stick</code>. Record whether the animation was physical or special.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>If the animation type was <u>physical</u>, type or click <code span class="fw-bold">0</code> into the <code span class="fw-bold">Animations</code> field of the SeedFinder.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>If the animation type was <u>special</u>, type or click <code span class="fw-bold">1</code> into the <code span class="fw-bold">Animations</code> field of the SeedFinder.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Repeat this process 128 times to get your seed, then click <code span class="fw-bold">Update Main Form</code> to send your seed into the main window.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If you do not want to use 0's and 1's for seed identification, owoow also accepts <code span class="fw-bold">,</code> or <code span class="fw-bold">s</code> for special inputs, and <code span class="fw-bold">.</code> or <code span class="fw-bold">p</code> for physical inputs, use whichever input is most comfortable for you.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>After finding your seed and updating the main window, you will want to confirm that the seed is correct. A single erroneous input can result in the wrong seed. This is best achieved using the following method:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Click <code class="fw-bold">Update Main Form</code> after identifying your seed using the Seed Finder to populate the seed fields on the main window.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>With the in-game pause menu still open, set your search range (the <code class="fw-bold">+</code> field) inside the Encounter Settings section to a small number and perform a filterless search (20-50 frame search is fine).</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>You will see that the next 20-50 search results have been produced. Now, look at the <code class="fw-bold">Animations</code> column of the table. Keep in mind that <code class="fw-bold">0</code> represents a physical animation and <code class="fw-bold">1</code> represents special.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>You should still be on the Pok&eacute;mon summary screen or the party list after identifying your seed. Perform some extra animations to confirm that the upcoming attack animations align with the next few results in the table.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Once you have confirmed that the animation pattern in the table properly matches, click the <code class="fw-bold">Generate</code> button in the Retail Tools section. You can now re-identify your current seed at any given point.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>To re-identify your current seed, enter the rough number of advances that have occurred into the <code class="fw-bold">+</code> field, then begin recording animations. It typically takes around 5-25 animations to find your seed.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Every time you want to find your current seed, you must click the Generate button and set the <code class="fw-bold">+</code> field accordingly, set the <code class="fw-bold">+</code> field based on how far you think you have advanced.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If you have a capture card that can stream your Switch video to a PC, you can try using <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1x1mIboSZB1a0GNKbco9-F9Gm5I9Lwvyr">NX RNG Tool</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/_3z8">_3z8</a>, which can automatically analyze attack animations to find your seed.</p>

    <span class="fw-bold">Important -</span> When re-identifying your seed after advancing the RNG state, you will need to set the value inside the <code class="fw-bold">+</code> field of the Retail Tools section to a value greater than the number of advances you believe have occurred. For example, if you believe that roughly 50000 advances have occurred and you now wish to re-identify your seed, make sure the value inside the <code class="fw-bold">+</code> field is set to a number that is > 50000 to avoid matching with an incorrect animation pattern.

<div class="alert alert-success" style="border: 1px solid #28a745; border-radius: 5px; padding: 15px;">
    <span class="fw-bold">Great!</span> You should now have a basic understanding of identifying and monitoring your current seed. Ensure that you have a solid understanding of how to apply these concepts before continuing.
