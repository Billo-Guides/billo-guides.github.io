<hr />

If you made it this far, it must mean you have an interest in RNG abusing Pokémon from static encounters! This page will cover the whole process, from finding a desirable location to achieving a final result.<br /> <br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Getting Started:</span></h3>
<u>Before starting, do the following:</u>
<ul>
  <li>Open the GUI and click on the <code>Encounter Lookup</code> button at the top of the main window. This will open the Encounter Lookup tab.</li>
  <li>Type the species name of the Pokémon you are hunting into the empty field. This will bring up a list of every possible encounter for that Pokémon.</li>
  <li>Scroll down the list of encounters and click on one of the rows displaying a STATIC encounter. This will automatically enter the information into the main window.</li>
  <li>Enter your 5 digit TID/SID into the fields on the main window, select <code>Shiny Charm</code> & <code>Mark charm</code> if you have them present in your save file.</li>
  <li>Head to the location in-game, change the date until you meet the correct weather condition, then stand near the spawn point of the Pokémon.</li>
  <li>Run far enough away to despawn the Pokémon and save, then press the <code>X</code> button to pause the game.</li>
</ul>

It's suggested to pick an encounter in a quiet area with calm weather to reduce instability. Noise is area specific, you should test how noisy an area is before attempting to RNG abuse Pokémon in it.<br /> <br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Identifying your Current Seeds:</span></h3>
It's impossible to search for results without knowing the current seeds. You can identify your current seed through the <code>Retail Seed Finder</code> window of the generator. Open it and begin recording your sequence of animations.<br /><br />

<u>Identifying your current seed using Retail Seed Finder:</u>
<ol>
  <li>Open the game and enter the overworld.</li>
  <li>Pause the game using <code>X</code>, click <code>Pokémon</code>, then view the summary of any of your Pokémon.</li>
  <li>Open the <code>Retail Seed Finder</code> window and have your Pokémon animate by pressing the <code>L3</code> button on your controller.</li>
  <li>Click (or type) <code>0</code> if your animation was physical.</li>
  <li>Click (or type) <code>1</code> if your animation was special.</li>
  <li>Repeat this process 128 times and your seed will be generated. Click <code>Update Main Form</code> and exit back to the main window.</li>
  <li>Search for a target frame.</li>
</ol>

This can seem like a lengthy and tedious process at first glance (it kinda is), and for this reason it's advised to remap your controller button layout if you are able to do so, such as remapping the <code>L3</code> button to <code>Y</code>. This is
done through the Switch system settings.<br /><br />

Once you know your seed you can easily re-identify your current state within 10-20 animations. This is done using the <code>Retail Advances Tracker</code> feature found on the main window.<br /><br />

<u>Re-identifying your current RNG states using the Retail Advances Tracker:</u>
<ol>
  <li>Click <code>Generate Pattern</code> once you have found your seeds using <code>Retail Seed Finder</code>.</li>
  <li>Pause the game using <code>X</code>, click <code>Pokémon</code>, then view the summary of any of your Pokémon and have it do some animations.</li>
  <li>Click (or type) <code>0</code> if your animation was physical.</li>
  <li>Click (or type) <code>1</code> if your animation was special.</li>
  <li>Repeat roughly 10-20 times until you are given 1 possible result. Click <code>Update States</code> to automatically paste your new seeds into the correct fields.</li>
  <li>Search for your target again. If you see your target on the generator again that means the original seed identification was correct and you can continue following the guide.</li>
  <li>If you cannot find your original target this means seed identification was incorrect and needs to be redone.</li>
</ol>

Seed re-identification plays a huge role, it helps us keep track of the amount of frame advancements between searches. This is extremely helpful for closing in on a specific target frame or finding out how many advancements a specific action
achieves.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">With all the required reading out of the way, it's time to get started!</span><br /><br />

<hr />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Time to Get to Work!</span></h3>
The goal is to walk towards the spawn point of the encounter on the calculated target frame displayed on the generator. The advancement methods used are listed on the main page of the guide.<br /><br />

Static encounters are guaranteed to be the same species every time until the weather in the area changes, weather changes on each new day. As long as the correct weather conditions are set, we will get the same species in the same location every time
the player walks into the spawn radius of the Pokémon.<br /><br />

In this example we will be aiming for a Shiny Aerodactyl with a mark in Giant's Bed. You can be more specific with the filters if you wish, such as filtering for a specific mark or specific IVs.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 1 -</span> Tool setup<br />
<img src="./images/static/figure-1-encounter-lookup-static-aerodactyl.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Awesome, everything looks good!</span> Our TID/SID and the details of the encounter have been entered into the main window. Time to find an ideal position to stand in-game and set the correct weather condition.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 2 -</span> Game setup<br />
<img src="./images/static/figure-2-in-game-setup.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<u>This location in Giant's Bed is ideal, there are no NPCs around and there are no other spawned Pokémon present in the overworld.</u><br /><br />

Giant's Bed is located within the Crown Tundra, which is a notably quiet area in calm weather conditions. This should simplify the process a lot as we will not have to deal with any instability from noise in the area.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 3 -</span> Seed identification<br />
<img src="./images/static/figure-3-seed-identification-static.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

After recording 128 animations the seed will be generated, clicking <code>Update Main Form</code> will automatically paste the information into the correct field of the main window.<br /><br />

Once the main window is filled in correctly, you've identified your current seeds & you are stood in a good position in-game, you can begin looking for target frames by clicking the search button on main window of the generator.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">If your results are not desirable, you will need to reset the game and identify your current seeds again.</span><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 4 -</span> Target found!<br />
<img src="./images/static/figure-4-static-search-aerodactyl.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">We found one!</span> A shiny, Gentle natured Aerodactyl in a cluster on advances 196-199. These are the "target frames" and the aim will be to spawn Aerodactyl in the overworld on any of these frames.<br /><br />

Once a Pokémon is spawned in the overworld, the stats and internal details (such as PID/EC) are generated and set in stone. This is why it is only important to spawn the Pokémon in the overworld on the correct frame.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Don't let the Pokémon despawn after you spawn it in the overworld!</span><br /><br />

It's common to see "clusters" or "groups" of frames that produce the same result when searching for a target. Aiming for large clusters is highly recommended as this will provide more chances for the player to spawn the Pokémon on the correct
frame.<br /><br />

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Advancing Towards the Target:</span></h5>
The generator displays the target on frame 196-199. Based on local testing, the delay for this static encounter is 0. This means the target remains at frame 196-199.<br /><br />

<u>Step by step:</u><br />
<ol>
  <li>Advance towards the target frame using bike, NPCs or by spawning overworld Pokémon in the area.</li><br />
  Consider using the date skipping technique to advance large distances.<br /><br />

  <li>Once you believe you are within a few hundred frames of your target, stand near to the spawn point of the Pokémon you are hunting, then pause the game with X.</li><br />

  <span class="fw-bold">From this point it's recommended to only advance using menu close, animation and bike advancements as they only advance in small increments, making them easy to keep track of.</span><br /><br />

  <li>Re-identify your current seed using the <code>Retail Advances Tracker</code>. Remember to click the <code>Update States</code> button after re-identification!<br /><br />
  You should be relatively close to your target frame at this stage and ideally the game should be paused to avoid any unwanted advancements.<br /><br />
  
  <li>Open the <code>Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> window and work out the amount of NPCs that are in the area, then enter your target frame into the <code>+</code> field of this window and hit search.</li><br />
  This can be used to accurately predict the number of advancements that occur from closing the pause menu, as explained on the <a href="https://billo-guides.github.io/retail/swsh/overworld">main page</a>.<br /><br />

  <span class="fw-bold">From this point it's recommended to only advance using menu close prediction, you can also use party animation advancements to nudge the frames forward one at a time if you need to.</span><br /><br />
  
  An example of a good time to use animations to nudge frames forward is when you are unable to find your target frame on the <code>Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> window, or need to advance small distances. (Each animation is a stable +1 advancement.)<br /><br />

  <li>Open and close the pause menu until closing the menu a single time lands onto your target frame, according to the <code>Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> prediction.</li><br />
  Pay close attention to how many times you have closed and re-opened the pause menu to avoid overshooting your target.<br /><br />

  <li>Close the pause menu and quickly run towards the spawn point of your Pokémon! Encounter and capture it, make sure all the internal details match the output shown on the generator.</li><br />
  Remember not to let it despawn!<br />
</ol>

You can be creative with the methods you use to advance the RNG state. Menu close prediction is not necessary but will make for a much easier time hitting target frames and is extremely helpful in the more noisy areas of the game.<br /><br />

<img src="./images/static/figure-5-static-hit-aerodactyl.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

By using animations and a standard calculator to keep track of inputs, we were able to hit out target frame!<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 6/7 -</span> Result Found!<br />

<span class="fw-bold">The Aerodactyl matches the output of the generator, mission accomplished!</span><br /><br />

Espeon in party slot 1 with the ability Syncronize was used to determine the nature, using a Pokémon with this ability will make the nature of any overworld Pokémon match the nature of yours.<br /><br />
