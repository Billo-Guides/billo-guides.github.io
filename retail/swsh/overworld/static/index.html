</div>

<hr />

If you made it this far, it must mean you have an interest in RNG abusing Pokémon from static encounters! This page will cover the whole process, from finding a desirable location to achieving a final result.<br /> <br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Getting Started:</span></h3>
<u>Before starting, do the following:</u>
<ul>
  <li>Open the GUI and click on the <code>Encounter Lookup</code> button at the top of the main window. This will open the Encounter Lookup tab.</li>
  <li>Type the species name of the Pokémon you are hunting into the empty field, this will bring up a list of every possible encounter for that Pokémon.</li>
  <li>Scroll down the list of encounters and click on one of the rows displaying a STATIC encounter, this will automatically enter the information into the main window.</li>
  <li>Enter your 5 digit TID/SID into the fields on the main window, select <code>Shiny Charm</code> & <code>Mark charm</code> if you have them present in your save file.</li>
  <li>Head to the location in-game, change the date until you meet the correct weather condition, then stand near the spawn point of the Pokémon.</li>
  <li>Run far enough away to despawn the Pokémon and save, then press the <code>X</code> button to pause the game.</li>
</ul>

It's suggested to pick an encounter in a quiet area with calm weather to reduce instability. Noise is area specific, you should test how noisy an area is before attempting to RNG abuse Pokémon in it.<br /> <br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Day Skipping:</span></h3>
If you plan to use the day skipping exploit to advance the RNG state you should take a moment to monitor your advances to avoid overshooting your target frame. Skip 1 day at a time and reidentify your current seed to get a rough estimate of how many frames will advance per day skipped.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Day skipping will change the weather in the area!</span> Be sure to set your date back to how it was originally to restore the weather condition.<br /><br />

Methods used for day skipping can be found on the main page of this guide.<br /><br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Identifying your current seeds:</span></h3>
It's impossible to search for results without knowing the current seeds, you can identify your current seed through the <code>Retail Seed Finder</code> window of the generator, open it and begin recording your sequence of animations.<br /><br />

<u>Identifying your current seed using Retail Seed Finder:</u>
<ol>
  <li>Open the game and enter the overworld.</li>
  <li>Pause the game using <code>X</code>, click <code>Pokémon</code>, then view the summary of any of your Pokémon.</li>
  <li>Open the <code>Retail Seed Finder</code> window and have your Pokémon animate.</li>
  <li>Click (or type) <code>0</code> if your animation was physical.</li>
  <li>Click (or type) <code>1</code> if your animation was special.</li>
  <li>Repeat this process 128 times and your seed will be generated. Click <code>Update Main Form</code> and exit back to the main window.</li>
</ol>

This can seem like a lengthy and tedious process at first glance (it kinda is), for this reason it's advised to remap your controller button layout if you are able to do so, such as remapping the <code>L3</code> button to <code>Y</code>. This is done through the Switch system settings.<br /><br />

Once you know your seed you can easily re-identify your current state within 10-20 animations, this is done using the <code>Retail Advances Tracker</code> feature found on the main window.<br /><br />

<u>Re-identifying your current RNG states using the Retail Advances Tracker:</u>
<ol>
  <li>Click <code>Generate Pattern</code> once you have found your seeds using Seed Finder.</li>
  <li>Pause the game using <code>X</code>, click <code>Pokémon</code>, then view the summary of any of your Pokémon and have it do some animations.</li>
  <li>Click (or type) <code>0</code> if your animation was physical.</li>
  <li>Click (or type) <code>1</code> if your animation was special.</li>
  <li>Repeat roughly 10-20 times until you are given 1 possible result. Click <code>Update States</code> to automatically paste your new seeds into the correct fields.</li>
  <li>Search for your target again.</li>
</ol>

Seed re-identification plays a huge role, it helps us keep track of the amount of frame advancements between searches. This is extremely helpful for closing in on a specific target frame or finding out how many advancements a specific action achieves.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">With all the required reading out of the way, it's time to get started!</span><br /><br />

<hr />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Time to get to work!</span></h3>
The goal is to walk towards the spawn point of the encounter on the calculated target frame displayed on the generator. The advancement methods used are listed on the main page of the guide.<br /><br />

Static encounters are guaranteed to be the same species every time until the weather in the area changes, weather changes on each new day. As long as the correct weather conditions are set we will get the same species in the same location every time the player walks into the spawn radius of the Pokémon.<br /><br />

In this example we will be aiming for a Shiny Aerodactyl with a mark in Giant's Bed. You can be more specific with the filters if you wish, such as filtering for a specific mark or specific IVs.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 1 -</span> Tool setup<br />
<img src="./images/static/figure-1-encounter-lookup-static-aerodactyl.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Awesome, everything looks good!</span> Our TID/SID and the details of the encounter have been entered into the main window. Time to find an ideal position to stand in-game and set the correct weather condition.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 2 -</span> Game setup<br />
<img src="./images/static/figure-2-in-game-setup.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<u>This location in Giant's Bed is ideal, there are no NPCs around and there are no other spawned Pokémon present in the overworld.</u><br /><br />

Giant's Bed is located within the Crown Tundra which is a notably quiet area in calm weather conditions, this should simplify the process a lot as we will not have to deal with any instability from noise in the area.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 3 -</span> Seed identification<br />
<img src="./images/static/figure-3-seed-identification-static.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />
  
After recording 128 animations the seed will be generated, clicking <code>Update Main Form</code> will automatically paste the information into the correct field of the main wndow, <span class="fw-bold">don't forget to do this before exiting the <code>Retail Seed Finder</code> tab!</span><br /><br />
  
Once the main window is filled in correctly, you've identified your current seeds & you are stood in a good position in-game, you can begin looking for target frames by clicking the search button on main window of the generator.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">If your results are not desirable, you will need to reset the game and identify your current seeds again.</span><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure  4 -</span> Target found!<br />
<img src="./images/static/figure-4-static-search-aerodactyl.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">We found one!</span> A shiny, Gentle natured Aerodactyl in a cluster on advances 196-199. These are the "target frames" and the aim will be to spawn Aerodactyl in the overworld on any of these frames.<br /><br />

Once a Pokémon is spawned in the overworld the stats and internal details (such as PID/EC) are generated and set in stone, this is why it is only important to spawn the Pokémon in the overworld on the correct frame. <span class="fw-bold">Don't let the Pokémon despawn after you spawn it in the overworld!</span><br /><br />

It's common to see "clusters" or "groups" of frames that produce the same result when searching for a target. Aiming for large clusters is highly recommended as this will provide more chances for the player to spawn the Pokémon on the correct frame.<br /><br />

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Advancing towards the target:</span></h5>
The generator displays the target on frame 196-199, based on local testing the delay for this static encounter is 0. This means the target remains at frame 196-199.<br /><br />

<u>Step by step:</u><br />
<ol>
  <li>Advance towards the target frame using bike, NPCs or by spawning overworld Pokémon in the area.</li><br />
If your target is a large number of frames away consider using the day skipping method described on the main page of this guide.<br /><br />

  <li>Once you believe you are close to the target (within ~500 frames), stand near to the spawn point of the Pokémon you are hunting and re-identify your current seed.</li><br />
Re-identify your current seed using the Pokémon summary screen, <u>not</u> by using the party menu.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">From this point it's recommended to only advance using menu close, animation and bike advancements as they only advance in small increments, making them easy to keep track of.</span><br /><br />

  <li>Quickly close and reopen the pause menu, re-identify your current seed and pay attention to the number of advancements that have passed, repeat this step roughly 5 times.</li><br />
It's important to know the average number of frames that will advance from closing the pause menu, we will eventually need to account for this to hit the correct target frame.<br /><br />

  <li>Advance closer to your target frame (within ~100 frames this time) and open the pause menu again, open the Pokémon summary page and re-identify your current seed once more.</li><br />
You should have a calculator available to use to keep track of inputs/advancements.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">From this point it's recommended to only advance using animations from the <u>party menu</u>, this provide a stable +1 advancement per input.</span><br /><br />

  <li>Open the party menu and advance to your target frame, you can use a calculator to keep track of inputs. Here's where we need to factor in the amount of advances that pass from closing the pause menu.</li><br />
For example, if 3 frames advance from closing the pause menu on average and the target was 100 advances away, we would advance to frame 97 using animations, then closing the pause menu would pick up the 3 advancements we need to hit the target frame.<br /><br />

  <li>Close the pause menu and quickly run towards the spawn point of your Pokémon! Encounter/capture it and make sure it matches the output shown on the generator.</li><br />
Remember not to let it despawn!<br />
</ol>

You can be creative with the methods you use to advance the RNG state.<br /><br />

By using animations and a standard calculator to keep track of inputs, we were able to hit out target frame!<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">The Aerodactyl matches the output of the generator, mission accomplished!</span><br /><br />

Espeon in party slot 1 with the ability Syncronize was used to determine the nature, using a Pokémon with this ability will make the nature of any overworld Pokémon match the nature of yours.<br /><br />

Different areas & environments can have a drastic influence on delay, if you are missing targets when you believe you should be finding results, you should consider reading the Troubleshooting Encounters section down below.<br /><br />

<hr />

<div class="bg-secondary title">
  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Troubleshooting Encounters</h1>
</div>

<hr />

This section covers how to troubleshoot encounters and delays. If you keep missing targets, spawning in the wrong Pokémon, or can't find your result on the generator at all, this is the place to be.<br /><br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Missing Targets:</span></h3>
<u>The commonly occuring reasons for missing a target Pokémon are:</u>
<ul>
  <li>Encounter spawned too early/late due to mistiming.</li>
  <li>There is a delay left unaccounted for.</li>
  <li>Information in the main window was not completely accurate.</li>
</ul>

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Encounter spawned too early or too late...</span></h5>

This is a common issue players will face when tackling static encounters and is likely due to mistiming when spawning the Pokémon. Retry and search for a new target frame and make sure your player positioning is correct.<br /><br />

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Troubleshooting delay...</span></h5>

For the purposes of this guide, the term "delay" is used to describe the frame difference between the Pokémon we encountered and the frame the encounter was initiated on.<br /><br />

Most static encounters do not need to account for delay, this applies most to encounters in extreme weather conditions or in an otherwise unstable environment, like having other spawned Pokémon present.<br /><br />

Delay Calc - <code>frame Pokemon was generated - frame encounter was initiated = delay</code><br /><br />

We can use an IV calculator to confirm the exact frame the encounter was generated on and calculate the delay from there. Here's how it's done!
<ul>
  <li>Aim for a target, such as any shiny Pokémon.</li>
  <li>Run towards the Pokémon and spawn it in the overworld then initiate the encounter. Take note of the frame the Pokémon was spawned on.</li>
  <li>Encounter the Pokémon and capture it, then calculate the exact IVs using an IV calculator such as the <a href="https://www.serebii.net/games/iv-calcswsh.shtml">this one by Serebii</a>.</li>
  <li>If you didn't find the Pokémon that you expected, search for the specific IVs of the result you found and find the frame you hit.</li>
  <li>Subtract your the frame the Pokémon was spawned on from the frame you actually hit.</li>
  <li>This will be your delay for that particular encounter.</li>
</ul>

<u>When RNG abusing in unstable conditions you should record delays for multiple attempts before aiming for a target and check for any consistent delay counts. It is also advised to aim for large clusters where possible to increase your chances of actually hitting the target.</u><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 8 -</span> Delay troubleshooting example<br />
<img src="./images/static/figure-8-troubleshooting-encounters.jpg" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

We encountered an Aerodactyl, but it wasn't shiny! So what happened here? Well... We miscalculated. Let's try to find the frame we actually hit.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 9 -</span> Calculating the IVs<br />
<img src="./images/static/figure-9-calculating-IVs.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

Using the IV calculator we can find the rough IVs of the Aerodactyl we hit and use this information to locate the exact frame we landed on according to the generator.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 10 -</span> Finding the frame<br />
<img src="./images/static/figure-10-locating-frame.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

By doing a filterless search we can see the shiny cluster, and frame we hit was 1 frame behind where we wanted to be, oh well! We will adjust accordingly for next time by spawning it in the overworld 1 frame later.<br /><br />

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Cannot find result...</span></h5>
If you cannot find the Pokémon you are in battle with anywhere on the tool this is likely due to one of two reasons:
<ul>
  <li>Player was positioned too close to the spawn and the Pokémon had already been generated long before walking into it.</li>
  <li>The information entered into the main window of the tool was not completely accurate.</li>
</ul>

Try to reposition your character and see if your issue persists, if you are still having problems double check the information on the main tab is entered correctly by searching it on the <code>Encounter Lookup</code> and clicking the correct row.<br /><br /> 

<u>You must pay attention to the row you are clicking and making sure it matches your in-game environment.</u><br /><br />

That's all there is to it!<br /><br />
