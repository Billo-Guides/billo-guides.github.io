<p>This guide explains how to RNG abuse Pokémon from Static encounters. It covers the entire process, from choosing a location to obtaining the desired Pokémon.</p>

<p>Static spawners consistently produce the same species until the weather changes, which can occur at midnight (00:00). Be mindful of the Switch system time to avoid spawning unexpected Pokémon due to incorrect weather conditions.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #b60606;">From here it is assumed that you have read the initial page of this guide and have a general idea of how to use SWSH OWRNG Generator GUI, as well as understanding how to find and monitor your seed.</span></p>

  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <ol>
      <li>Open SWSH_OWRNG_Generator_GUI, then type your 5 digit TID/SID into the correct fields of the main window if you plan to RNG abuse shiny Pokémon.</li><p></p>
      <li>Open the <code span class="fw-bold">Encounter Lookup</code> sub window, then type the species name of the Pokémon you plan to RNG abuse.</li><p></p>
      <li>Select a row that appeals to you from the list of encounters, this will fill in all of the encounter filters on the main window automatically.</li><p></p>
      <li>Confirm that the filters have been set properly inside the Main Window, encounter filters can be found on the left-hand side.</li><p></p>
      <li>Set your search filters inside the middle portion of the Main Window. You can filter for specific Marks, IVs, Shininess, etc.</li><p></p>
      <li>Fly to the correct location in-game and save. Make sure you are standing far enough away from your target Pokémon to properly despawn it.</li><p></p>

<h6><span class="fw-bold">Using Aerodactyl as the example:</span></h6>
<p>The Encounter Lookup specifies Giant's Bed with Clear weather for this encounter. Clicking the row of the table automatically fills in all of the relevant encounter information on the left-hand side of the main window.</p>

<p>The search filters, in the middle of the main window, were manually configured to search for any shiny with any mark, you can be more specific with the filters if you wish, such as filtering for IVs/Nature.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold">With all the setup instructions out of the way, let's get to work.</span></p>

<hr /><div class="title" style="background-color: #0c0038;">
  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">The Process</h1>
</div><hr />

<p>The end goal is to spawn the Pokémon on the calculated target frame provided by the generator search results. Once a Pokémon spawns in the overworld, its stats and details are fixed.</p>

<p>Ensure your encounter and search filters are properly configured before continuing (see Figure 1). The advancement methods used to achieve the result are listed in the table found on the main page.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>For Static encounters, stand where there is a clear, straight line between you and the target Pokémon. Avoid areas that trigger other Wild/Static spawns. Once you have good positioning, calculate the amount of NPCs using the method described on the main page of the guide.</p>

    <p>The location in the above image is ideal: Minimal NPCs, no extra spawned Pokémon, and a clear line to the target spawner.</p>

    <p>Giant's Bed, in the Crown Tundra Wild Area, is notably "quiet" in calm weather. Remember, advancement speed (aka noise) depends on location, NPC count, and weather. The more quiet the area, the better.</p>

    <blockquote>If you can't find a good spot, knock out any static spawns blocking your path. They will remain despawned until you return after a date change.</blockquote>

<p>You cannot search for targets without knowing your current seed. This is achieved by using the <code span class="fw-bold">Retail Seed Finder</code> window. If you already know how to find and monitor your seed you can skip this section and begin finding your current seed.</p>

    <span class="fw-bold text-light">(Re)Identifying your seed</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>The Retail Seed Finder sub-window is where players can calculate their current seed, this is done by recording a sequence of 128 motions/animations in a row. If you are unsure what an animation is at this stage, go back and read the information on the main page.</p>
          
    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Initial Seed finding instructions:</span></h6>
      <ol>
        <li>Open the pause menu in-game, then open the <code span class="fw-bold">Retail Seed Finder</code> sub-window on SwSh OWRNG Generator GUI.</li>
        <li>Open the party menu, select the Pokémon you will use to record animations, then click <code span class="fw-bold">Summary</code>.</li>
        <li>Use the <code span class="fw-bold">L3</code> button to cause an animation, take note of if the animation was physical or special.</li>
        <li>If the animation was physical, press the <code span class="fw-bold">(0) Physical</code> button. If the animation was special, press the <code span class="fw-bold">(1) Special</code> button.</li>
        <li>Repeat this process 128 times in a row and a seed will be produced. Click the <code span class="fw-bold">Update Main Form</code> button to paste it into the main window.</li>
        <li>If a seed was not produced this indicates that the animations were not recorded properly, try again.</li>
      </ol>

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Seed re-identification:</span></h6>
    <p>Re-identifying your current seed is done using the Retail Advances Tracker feature of the Main Window, and is essentially a simplified version of finding your seed using animations.</p>
    
      <ol>
        <li>Click the <code span class="fw-bold">Generate Pattern</code> button after initially identifying your seed.</li>
        <li>Record a sequence of 8-20 animations using the above mentioned method, the amount can vary but should be relatively quick.</li>
        <li>Once a seed has been produced, click the <code span class="fw-bold">Update States</code> button to paste your current seed into the top-left of the main window.</li>
        <li>Search for your target again using the main window. If you see the same target, your re-identification was correct. Otherwise you will need to try again.</li>
      </ol>

    <blockquote>Recording animations through the Pokémon summary screen is recommended, this is due to the party menu advancing +1 per button clicked, the summary screen advances +1 per animation, making it easier to keep track of.</blockquote>

<p>After searching a desired result, we've found a shiny, Gentle natured Aerodactyl in a cluster on advances 196-199. Target frames often appear in clusters, which are multiple frames in a row yield the same result. A larger cluster increases your chances of hitting the target frame.</p>

<details>
  <summary><span class="fw-bold">Undesirable result?</span></summary>
  <ol>
    <li>Disconnect from the program, and restart the game to refresh the seed.</li>
    <li>Enter the overworld, pause the game, then identify your current seed again.</li>
    <li>Search for a new target frame, repeat this process until a desirable result shows in the generator search results.</li>
  </ol>
</details><p></p>

<p>Once you have found a good position, have calibrated the NPC count, and found a desirable result, you can continue following the guide.</p>

  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Advancing Towards the Target!</h1>
</div><hr />

<p>First, you will need to calculate the rough delay for the encounter. Doing this step will provide the best possible chances of hitting your target frame. Delay is the difference in advancements between spawning the Pokémon in the overworld and the actual frame the Pokémon was generated on.</p>

<div class="card border-dark">
  <div class="anchored card-header" style="background-color: #0c0038;" id="delay-calculation-retail">
    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Delay Calculation</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>From here it is assumed you already know the number of NPCs inside the area you plan to RNG abuse, if you do not have this number, find it now using the method on the main page.</p>
    
    <h6 span class="fw-bold">Delay Calculation</h6>
    <ol>
      <li>Stand in an ideal in-game position with a clear line between you and your target Pokémon, you should be standing far enough away for it to be despawned.</li><p></p>
      <li>Calculate the number of NPCs at this stage if you have not already done so, then open the <code class="fw-bold">Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> sub window.</li><p></p>
      <li>Type the number of NPCs into the <code class="fw-bold">NPCs</code> field, and click search. This will provide you with the correct <code class="fw-bold">Jump</code> value.</li><p></p>
      <li>With the game still paused, re-identify your current seed using the <code class="fw-bold">Retail Advances Tracker </code> on the main window, update the states and perform a filterless search.</li><p></p>
      <li>Unpause the game, run towards the spawn point of your target Pokémon, then initiate the encounter, keep in mind the amount of advances that were consumed from closing the pause menu.</li><p></p>
      <li>Catch the Pokémon, then enter the stats into any IV calculator to get a rough idea of the IVs of the Pokémon you hit. Also take note of the nature of the Pokémon you found.</li><p></p>
      <li>Find the Pokémon you hit in the search results of the GUI, this should be relatively close to your start frame. Check to see which advancement generated your Pokémon.</li><p></p>
      <li>Subtract the amount of advancements that were consumed by closing the pause menu, this figure will then be your delay for this particular encounter.</li><p></p> 
    </ol>

    <blockquote><span class="fw-bold">Example:</span> If the Pokémon was generated on frame 10, and 7 frames were consumed from closing the pause menu, this means the delay for this encounter is 3.</blockquote>

   </div>
 </div><br>

 <p>At this stage you should now know have calibrated both the NPC count and the delay for the encounter, take note of both of these values as they are significantly important for hitting target frames consistently.</p>

      <h6 class="fw-bold">Step-by-step tutorial:</h6>

      <ul>
        <li>Advance towards your target frame using any method listed in the table on the main page (consider date-skipping for long distance-advancements).</li><p></p>
        <li>Return to the correct position in-game when you are a few thousand frames away from the desired target. Ensure the target is despawned.</li><p></p>
        <li>Pause the game, then re-identify your current seed. Press the search button again to set a new target frame.</li><p></p>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>At this stage, we recommend using menu close prediction & animation advancements for accurate, small, and manageable advancement increments.</blockquote>

      <ul>
        <li>Open the Menu Close Advances Viewer tab, and enter the number of NPCs calculated earlier in the <code span class="fw-bold">NPCs</code> field.</li><p></p>
        <li>Enter your target frame into the empty <code span class="fw-bold">+</code> field, factor in your calibrated delay (e.g <code span class="fw-bold">1000 (target) - 3 (delay) = 997 (new target)</code>).</li><p></p>
        <li>Hit search, you should now see a list of frames in the table, see if your exact target frame, great! This means menu close prediction can be used to hit it.</li><p></p>
        <li>If you do not see your target frame in the search results, use animation advancements to increment the RNG state by 1, then repeat the above steps until visible.</li><p></p>
      </ul>

      <blockquote><p>If you are nudging the RNG state, you will need to grab your seed from the main window search results. It should be relatively simple enough to track your seed this way using animations.</p>

      <p>In rare cases, you may not be able to hit the desired frame using menu close prediction alone. Use it to get as close as possible, then use movement advances to reach your target instead.</blockquote>

      <ul>
        <li>Open and close the pause menu until a single menu close lands you onto (or as close as possible) the target frame.</li><p></p>
        <li>Unpause the game, then move towards the spawn point of your desired Pokémon to spawn it in the overworld as quickly as possible.</li><p></p>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>If you do not land directly onto your target frame, this is the point where you should use movement advancements, do so before spawning your desired Pokémon in the overworld.</blockquote>

      <ul>
        <li>Initiate the encounter to check if you've hit the correct target frame. If the result is unexpected, recalibrate your NPC count and delay, then retry. Be quick to spawn your Pokémon in the overworld to avoid overshooting.</li>
      </ul>
