    <p>Static spawners are guaranteed to produce the same Pokemon species until the weather in the area changes, the weather can potentially change after a day has passed, when the clocks turn to midnight.</p>

    <p>The end goal is to spawn your target on the correct frame, once a Pokemon is spawned in the overworld, the stats and other internal details are set in stone until the Pokemon has been despawned.</p>

    <p>Ensure your system clock is not synced by the internet in the Switch system settings, and change the time backwards if you are close to midnight to avoid accidentally changing the species.</p>

  <div class="card-body card-bg"> 
    <ol>
      <li>Open SWSH_OWRNG_Generator_GUI, then type your 5 digit TID/SID into the correct fields of the main window (for shiny Pokemon only).</li><p></p>
      <li>Open the <code span class="fw-bold">Encounter Lookup</code> sub window, then type the species name of the Pokémon you plan to RNG abuse, select an appealing encounter.</li><p></p>
      <li>Confirm that the filters have been set properly inside the Main Window, encounter filters can be found on the left-hand side.</li><p></p>
      <li>Set your search filters inside the middle portion of the Main Window. You can filter for specific Marks, IVs, Shininess, etc.</li><p></p>
    </ol>

    <blockquote><span class="fw-bold">Example -</span> Encounter Lookup specifies Giant's Bed in clear weather for Aerodactyl, the information has been automatically filled inside the main window. The search filters were also manually configured to search for a Shiny Aerodactyl with any mark.</blockquote>

  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>For Static encounters, stand where there is a clear, straight line between you and the target Pokémon. Avoid areas that trigger other Wild/Static spawns. The positioning in Figure 2 is ideal, minimal NPCs, no extra spawned Pokemon, and a clear line between the player and the target spawner.</p>
  
    <p>Giant's Bed is notably "quiet" in calm weather. Advancement speed is based on location, NPC count, and weather. The more quiet the area, the slower the natural advancements are, and the easier it will be to hit your target frame.</p>

    <blockquote>If you can't find a good spot, knock out any static spawns blocking your path. They will remain despawned until you return to the area after a date change.</blockquote>

<p>You cannot search for targets without knowing your current seed. This is achieved by using the <code span class="fw-bold">Retail Seed Finder</code> window. If you did not read the section of the main page that covers how to find and monitor your seed, go back and do this now.</p>

<p>After searching a desired result, we've found a shiny, Gentle natured Aerodactyl in a cluster on advances 196-199. Target frames often appear in clusters, which are multiple frames in a row yield the same result. A larger cluster increases your chances of hitting the target frame.</p>

<details>
  <summary><span class="fw-bold">Undesirable result?</span></summary>
  <ol>
    <li>Disconnect from the program, and restart the game to refresh the seed.</li>
    <li>Enter the overworld, pause the game, then identify your current seed again.</li>
    <li>Search for a new target frame, repeat this process until a desirable result shows in the generator search results.</li>
  </ol>
</details><p></p>

<p>Once you have found a good position, have calibrated the NPC count, and found a desirable result, you can continue following the guide.</p>

<hr /><div class="title" style="background-color: #0c0038;">
  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Advancing Towards the Target!</h1>
</div><hr />

<p>First, you will need to calculate the rough delay for the encounter. Doing this step will provide the best possible chances of hitting your target frame. Delay is the difference in advancements between spawning the Pokémon in the overworld and the actual frame the Pokémon was generated on.</p>

<div class="card border-dark">
  <div class="anchored card-header" style="background-color: #0c0038;" id="delay-calculation-retail">
    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Delay Calculation</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>From here it is assumed you already know how to calibrate your NPC count, if you do not know how to do this, go back to the main page.</p>
    
    <h6 span class="fw-bold">Delay Calculation</h6>
    <ol>
      <li>Stand in an ideal in-game position with a clear line between you and your target Pokémon, you should be standing far enough away for it to be despawned.</li><p></p>
      <li>Calculate the number of NPCs at this stage if you have not already done so, then open the <code class="fw-bold">Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> sub window.</li><p></p>
      <li>Type the number of NPCs into the <code class="fw-bold">NPCs</code> field, and click search. This will provide you with the correct <code class="fw-bold">Jump</code> value.</li><p></p>
      <li>With the game still paused, re-identify your current seed using the <code class="fw-bold">Retail Advances Tracker </code> on the main window, update the states and perform a filterless search.</li><p></p>
      <li>Unpause the game, run towards the spawn point of your target Pokémon, then initiate the encounter, keep in mind the amount of advances that were consumed from closing the pause menu.</li><p></p>
      <li>Catch the Pokémon, then enter the stats into any IV calculator to get a rough idea of the IVs of the Pokémon you hit. Also take note of the nature of the Pokémon you found.</li><p></p>
      <li>Find the Pokémon you hit in the search results of the GUI, this should be relatively close to your start frame. Check to see which advancement generated your Pokémon.</li><p></p>
      <li>Subtract the amount of advancements that were consumed by closing the pause menu, this figure will then be your delay for this particular encounter.</li><p></p> 
    </ol>

    <blockquote><span class="fw-bold">Example:</span> If the Pokémon was generated on frame 10, and 7 frames were consumed from closing the pause menu, this means the delay for this encounter is 3.</blockquote>

   </div>
 </div><br>

 <p>At this stage you should now know have calibrated both the NPC count and the delay for the encounter, take note of both of these values as they are significantly important for hitting target frames consistently.</p>

      <span class="fw-bold text-light">Hitting Your Target Frame:</span>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
      <h6 class="fw-bold">Step-by-step tutorial:</h6>

      <ul>
        <li>Advance towards your target frame using any method listed in the table on the main page (consider date-skipping for long distance-advancements).</li><p></p>
        <li>Return to the correct position in-game when you are a few thousand frames away from the desired target. Ensure the target is despawned.</li><p></p>
        <li>Set the weather condition in the area you are hunting in if necessary, by changing the Switch system time BACKWARDS to avoid unwanted advancements.</li><p></p>
        <li>Pause the game, then re-identify your current seed. Press the search button again to set a new target frame.</li><p></p>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>At this stage, we recommend using menu close prediction & animation advancements for accurate, small, and manageable advancement increments.</blockquote>

      <ul>
        <li>Open the Menu Close Advances Viewer tab, and enter the number of NPCs calculated earlier in the <code span class="fw-bold">NPCs</code> field.</li><p></p>
        <li>Enter your target frame into the empty <code span class="fw-bold">+</code> field, factor in your calibrated delay (e.g <code span class="fw-bold">1000 (target) - 3 (delay) = 997 (new target)</code>).</li><p></p>
        <li>Hit search, you should now see a list of frames in the table, see if your exact target frame, great! This means menu close prediction can be used to hit it.</li><p></p>
        <li>If you do not see your target frame in the search results, use animation advancements to increment the RNG state by 1, then repeat the above steps until visible.</li><p></p>
      </ul>

      <blockquote><p>If you are nudging the RNG state, you will need to grab your seed from the main window search results. It should be relatively simple enough to track your seed this way using animations.</p>

      <p>In rare cases, you may not be able to hit the desired frame using menu close prediction alone. Use it to get as close as possible, then use movement advances to reach your target instead.</blockquote>

      <ul>
        <li>Open and close the pause menu until a single menu close lands you onto (or as close as possible) the target frame.</li><p></p>
        <li>Unpause the game, then move towards the spawn point of your desired Pokémon to spawn it in the overworld as quickly as possible.</li><p></p>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>If you do not land directly onto your target frame, this is the point where you should use movement advancements, do so before spawning your desired Pokémon in the overworld.</blockquote>

      <ul>
        <li>Initiate the encounter to check if you've hit the correct target frame. If the result is unexpected, recalibrate your NPC count and delay, then retry. Be quick to spawn your Pokémon in the overworld to avoid overshooting.</li>
      </ul>
