</div>

<hr />

This guide will provide in-depth coverage of how to RNG abuse all types of overworld-based encounters in Sword/Shield by using the SWSH Overworld RNG Generator by <a href="https://github.com/LegoFigure11LegoFigure11">LegoFigure11</a>. 
Overworld RNG abuse can be used to obtain shiny and/or marked Pokémon from wild encounters! This can also be used to calculate other internal values such as IVs, nature, and gender.<br /> <br />

<span class="fw-bold">This guide assumes you are using a vanilla Switch console running official stock firmware.</span><br /> <br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Getting Started:</span></h3>
<u>You will need:</u>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/LegoFigure11/swsh-overworld-rng-gui/releases">SWSH Overworld RNG Generator</a></li> 
  <li>A standard calculator</li> 
</ul>

Download and extract all the contents from the <code>SWSH_OWRNG_Generator_GUI.zip</code> into an empty folder and run the <code>.exe</code> file.<br /><br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Tool Setup:</span></h3>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 1 -</span> Main window overview<br />
<img src="./overworld/images/main-page/figure-1-main-window-overview.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<u>Let's take a closer look at the main window:</u>
<ul>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">The TID/SID fields expect you to input the 5 digit TID/SID of your save file.</span> This is a requirement for the generator to produce accurate results for shiny Pokémon.
  <li><span class="fw-bold">The empty field below Init. adv. is the frame range or amount of frames to search through.</span> Set this to an amount you are comfortable with.</li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">You can use the IVs/Shiny/Mark filters to search for specific internal details.</span> On Symbol or Fishing encounters you can even filter for Pokémon with Brilliant Aura!</li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">The encounter details left should be filled out according to your desired hunt.</span> We can quickly find this information using the Encounter Lookup tab.</li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">You should check the Shiny Charm and Mark Charm boxes if those items are present your save file.</span> It's recommended to aquire both of these items before starting.</li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">The Retail Advances Tracker is used frequently to re-identify our current RNG states with far fewer motions needed.</span> You can usually re-identify in 10-20 recorded motions.</li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">The Read Encounter & DaySkip features are exclusive to players running CFW.</span></li>
</ul>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 2 -</span> Retail Seed Finder overview<br />
<img src="./overworld/images/main-page/figure-2-seedfinder-tab-overview.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

This is the <code>Retail Seed Finder</code> tab. Here, you will record a sequence of 128 motions/animations in order to find your current seed.

<h3><span class="fw-bold">What are Motions/Animations?</span></h3>
The term "motions" or "animations" refers to a feature of the Pokémon summary page. When pressing the <code>L3</code> button, your Pokémon will do one of two animations, physical or special.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 3 -</span> Animation differences<br />
<img src="./overworld/images/main-page/figure-3-animations.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<ol>
  <li>In the first animation, we can see Espeon lunging towards the screen. (Physical)</li>
  <li>In the second animation, we can see Espeon remaining in place using psychic. (Special)</li>
</ol>

Animations can be used on the party menu and Pokémon summary screens. When identifying your current seed, you should use the summary screen to avoid any unwanted advancements from the party menu.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 4 -</span> Encounter Lookup tab overview<br />
<img src="./overworld/images/main-page/figure-4-encounter-lookup.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

This is the <code>Encounter Lookup</code> tab. Searching for a specific species in the dropdown list will bring up a list of every possible wild encounter for that Pokémon in the entire game.<br /><br />

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Environment Control:</span></h5>
For the purposes of this guide, the term "noisy" is used to describe an area or environment in which the RNG state naturally advances at a fast pace.<br /><br />

<u>There are three main contributors to the amount of natural noise in an area, these are:</u>
<ol>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Location -</span> Some areas will simply be more noisy than others.</li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Weather -</span> Extreme weather conditions such as rain, thunderstorm, and sandstorm will have a large effect on noise.</li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Other Pokémon that are present -</span> Having other Pokémon spawned will advance the RNG state moreso than if there were none spawned.</li>
</ol>

<u>Examples:</u><br />
- In Crown Tundra, the area is naturally <u>quiet</u>, so we will have a <u>relatively easy</u> time hunting a Pokémon in clear weather conditions.<br />
- In Isle of Armor, the area is naturally <u>noisy</u>, so we will have a <u>more difficult</u> time hunting Pokémon in general.<br />
- If we added rainy weather to either of these situations we would increase the amount of natural noise and further increase the instability.<br /><br />

In all cases, it's best to target a Pokémon in a quiet area. However, sometimes you will be forced into an unstable environment due to a lack of options.<br /><br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Advancing the RNG State:</span></h3>
<u>Multiple in-game actions can be used to advance the RNG state with varying influence, these include:</u>
<ol>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Player movement -</span> Each time the player stops moving the control stick, the RNG state will advance a small amount - Roughly 1-3 advancements per input.</li><br />
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Rotom Bike -</span> Mounting and dismounting the bike with the <code>+</code> button will advance the RNG state a small amount. - Area specific advancements.</li><br />
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Menu close -</span> Opening and closing the pause menu will advance the RNG state a small amount depending on your location and amount of NPCs in the area. - Area specific advancements.</li><br />
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Animations -</span> Having your Pokemon animate on the party summary screen will advance the RNG state a small amount. - One advancement per "click" on the party menu, 1 advancement per motion on the summary page.</li><br />
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Active NPCs -</span> Standing near an NPC will cause them to become active, this will advance the RNG state rapidly. - Area specific advancements, good for covering large amounts of advancements quickly.</li><br />
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Map & Flying -</span> Flying into an area will advance the RNG state too! - Area specific advancements, this is only used for Articuno, Zapdos and Moltres.</li><br />
</ol>

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Day Skipping:</span></h3>

We can use Day Skipping to advance up to a total of around 13,000 advancements per day skipped. The amount of frames that advance by Day Skipping is heavily influenced by the amount of Pokémon currently stored in your boxes (not including eggs). The number will increase drastically if you store more Pokémon.<br /><br /> 

Exiting a ranked battle gives us the conditions we need to perform easy date skipping on retail hardware.<br /><br /> 

If you plan to use the day skipping exploit, you should take a moment to monitor your advances to avoid overshooting your target frame. Skip 1 day at a time and reidentify your current seed to get a rough estimate of how many frames will advance per day skipped. (More on seed identification later!)<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Day skipping will change the weather in the area!</span> Be sure to set your date back to how it was originally to restore the weather condition.<br /><br />

<u>To perform the day skipping technique follow these instructions:</u>
<ol>
  <li>Pause the game and press VS to enter a ranked battle.</li>
  <li>Forfeit once you enter the battle. Alternatively you can play out the whole battle if you wish.</li>
  <li>From here navigate to the System Settings and change the date ahead by one day.</li>
  <li>Exit back to the main menu of the home screen and reopen the game.</li>
  <li>Repeat step 4 and 5.</li>
</ol> 

You should notice time-based events such as the Rotom Lottery function have reset, this is an indication that the exploit has been properly activated.<br /><br />

<hr />

Already know your TID/SID combination or have no interest in RNG abusing shiny Pokémon? Great! You can continue reading the information on this page.<br /><br />

There are four types of encounters: Static, Symbol, Hidden, & Fishing. Each method has differing techniques you can use, and it's important to understand the types of encounters before making attempts.<br /><br />

Galarian Articuno, Zapdos and Moltres are static encounters with a unique method of RNG abuse, for this reason they have been covered on a seperate page.<br /><br />

<u>First, lets give definitions to each type of encounter...</u><br />
<ul>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Static -</span> These are the 100% chance-of-encounter spawns with an overworld model. <u>Cannot be Brilliant Aura.</u></li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Symbol -</span> These are the by-chance encounters in the grass with an overworld model. <u>Can be Brilliant Aura.</u></li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Hidden -</span> These are the by-chance encounters in the grass that do not have an overworld model, they're indicated by the "!" symbol when walking into a patch of grass. <u>Cannot be Brilliant Aura.</u></li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Fishing -</span> These are the by-chance encounters in the water that do not have an overworld model, they're indicated by rippling areas in the water. <u>Can be Brilliant Aura.</u></li>
</ul>

<span class="fw-bold">Great! Now that we know all the terminology, it's time to get started!</span><br /><br />

Search the species you wish to hunt on the <code>Encounter Lookup</code> tab of the generator and pick one of the encounters from the list. Take note of the type of encounter you have chosen and click on the page that applies to you!<br /><br />
