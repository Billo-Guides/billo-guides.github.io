<p>This tutorial provides a range of methods for how you can find your 5 digit TID/SID combination in Sword/Shield. Knowing these values is necessary if you wish to RNG abuse shiny Pokémon from overworld encounters.</p>

        <p>It is not possible to RNG abuse your TID or SID in Sword/Shield. This tutorial is only for finding your internal TID/SID on an existing save file. There are three possible methods you can use:</p>

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">Using SysBot.NET</span></h6>
        <p>SysBot.NET is a bot service hosted by members of the community, typically found in Discord servers. If you do not have access to a SysBot, you can find a public server with a quick Google search.</p>

        <p>SysBots come with dump functionality, which dumps the data of the shown Pokémon into a <code span class="fw-bold">.pk8</code> file. This file is then uploaded to your Discord messages.</p>

        <p>The file can then be manually inspected using a program like PKHeX to view your TID/SID combination. This method is recommended as it takes the least effort, but does require a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.</p>

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">Help from a Friend</span></h6>
        <p>If you have a friend with a CFW Switch console, you can trade with them and they can dump the Pok&eacute;mon file for you. It can then be opened in PKHeX.</p>

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">Finding a Shiny Pok&eacute;mon</span></h6>
        <p>If you do not want to use anyone's CFW, it is possible to find TID/SID using entirely stock methods. This is very time-consuming as you will need to find a shiny Pok&eacute;mon. The older <a href="https://github.com/LegoFigure11/swsh-overworld-rng-gui/releases">swsh-overworld-rng-gui</a> program can help with the calculation. However, the steps will not be covered in this guide.</p>

    <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Finding TID/SID using CFW</h1>
</div>
<hr />

<p>As mentioned above, by having access to a CFW Switch console we can easily find our TID/SID combination. The method will differ slightly depending on if you are using a SysBot or asking a friend to help.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that SysBot hosts are not constantly available. Join a public server that contains an active Sword/Shield bot, then follow the instructions given by the bot host. If you do not have a Discord account you will need to make one or ask a friend for help instead.</p>

    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <h6><span class="fw-bold">Requirements</span></h6>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://projectPok&eacute;mon.org/home/files/file/1-pkhex/" target="_blank">PKHeX</a></li>
            <li>Nintendo Switch Online Subscription</li>
            <li>A Discord account (for SysBot.NET)</li>
        </ul>

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">Tutorial</span></h6>
        <ul>
            <li>Extract the contents of the PKHeX download into an empty folder in a known location on your PC.</li>
            <li>Click <code span class="fw-bold">Options</code> at the top of the window, then click <code span class="fw-bold">Settings</code>. Change the Blank Save Version to Sword or Shield. Close this window.</li>
            <li>Dump the <code span class="fw-bold">.pk8</code> file of a Pokémon that was caught in the save file you wish to check the TID/SID on with a SysBot or with a friend's help.</li>
            <li>Drag the file into the PKHeX window. You should now see the details on screen. Head over to the <code span class="fw-bold">OT/Misc</code> tab to view Trainer Information.</li>
            <li>Hover over the TID field with your mouse. This will reveal the 5 digit TID/SID combination. Take note of these values, as you will need them for any RNG manipulation involving shiny Pok&eacute;mon.</li>
        </ul>

<p>In this example we can see that the TID/SID combination is 28888/10267. Save this somewhere where you will not lose it! Enter the values into the TID/SID fields on owoow.</p>

<p>After entering your ID values into owoow, select your game version and <code class="fw-bold">Shiny Charm?</code>/<code class="fw-bold">Mark Charm?</code> checkboxes if those items are present within your save file. Upon restarting the program these details will be saved for future use.</p>
