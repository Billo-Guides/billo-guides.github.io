            <li>Now that you are standing in the correct position, save and reboot the game. Immediately open the pause menu and identify your seed. Keep the pause menu open after doing so to avoid unwanted advances.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Calibrate your NPC count, then close the <code class="fw-bold">MenuCloseTimeline</code> subwindow. Verify that your NPC count has been entered into the main window and both <code class="fw-bold">Consider Menu Close?</code> and <code class="fw-bold">Holding Direction?</code> are checked.</li>
            <p></p>
            <ul>
                <li>While <code class="fw-bold">Holding Direction?</code> is not mandatory for hidden RNG in calm weather, this is highly recommended since extra time spent on the overworld easily disrupts the RNG process.</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <li>Search for a target that can be triggered within 1-2 steps (see the <code class="fw-bold">Step</code> column of the search table). If you do not find any results, consider restarting the game to reset your seed, increasing your search range, or applying less strict search filters.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Once you have found a target frame that can be reached using menu close prediction, take note of your positioning if you plan to leave the area for advancements. If you change location or move the character, you will need to re-populate the field and re-calibrate your NPC count again.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The calibration checkboxes (<code class="fw-bold">Consider Menu Close?</code> / <code class="fw-bold">Holding Direction?</code>) account for the advances consumed when closing the pause menu. The number of advances varies depending on whether you are holding a direction on your control stick when unpausing. Make sure you have the correct boxes checked; the search result table uses these checkboxes to calculate the exact frame on which to close the pause menu and spawn your target Pok&eacute;mon.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>In this example, a shiny, Vigor Mark Mime Jr. appears in a {% include tooltips/clusters.html %} from advances 16,475-16,477 with a step count of 1. The calibrated NPC count is 8 and a direction should be held when closing the pause menu.</p>

        <h6 class="fw-bold">Step-by-Step</h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Advance toward your target using a method that does not cause the player to move. There are some important considerations for the best way to advance:</li>
            <p></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The more time you spend on the overworld, the more inaccurate your previous calibration will be. This is because the spawned Pok&eacute;mon wander, which means they can despawn, run into you, or walk into a position that causes extra advances when you finally attempt the RNG manipulation.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>If you freshly boot into the game while positioned in the grass and immediately open the in-game pause menu, the spawned overworld Pok&eacute;mon will not start moving for a while. This can be a way to calibrate more consistently.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Unfortunately, options for advancing with the menu open are limited and slow. It may be worth investing in a controller with turbo capabilities.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>If your target is <span class="fw-bold">not in a cluster</span>, it is recommended to use <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/overworld/advancing-rng-state/wet-weather-menuing.gif">wet weather menuing</a> for a larger number of advances as this limits overworld exposure and provides more consistency for single-frame targets.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>If your target <span class="fw-bold">is in a cluster</span> of three or more, you can consider using overworld advancement methods such as <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/overworld/advancing-rng-state/wet-weather.gif">wet weather</a> or <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/overworld/advancing-rng-state/date-skipping.gif">date skipping</a>. You will likely only be able to do this for a few seconds because more time spent on the overworld risks making your previous calibrations inaccurate.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>If you prefer to stay off of the overworld entirely and are willing to spend a long time advancing, it is even plausible to use <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/overworld/advancing-rng-state/animations.gif">attack animations</a> only.</li>
                <p></p>
            </ul>
            <li>Re-identify your seed periodically to avoid overshooting, and stop advancing the RNG state once you are roughly 500-1000 advances away from your target. A larger buffer may be needed if you used wet-weather menuing and need to change the weather back.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Ensure that the weather condition is correct both in-game and on owoow if you have changed it.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Ensure the <code class="fw-bold">Consider Menu Close?</code> and <code class="fw-bold">Holding Direction?</code> checkboxes are checked, and verify that your NPC count is calibrated correctly.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Re-identify your seed and search for your target again. From here, use <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/overworld/advancing-rng-state/animations.gif">attack animations</a> to reach the exact target frame. Each <code class="fw-bold">L3</code> button input on the party list advances the RNG state by +1 (100 inputs = 100 advances).</li>
            <p></p>
            <ul>
                <li>When you are under 100 advances, you can consider unticking the <code class="fw-bold">Filters Enabled?</code> checkbox and clicking <code class="fw-bold">Search!</code>. This will generate the next 100 frames and allow you to see the predicted attack animations corresponding to each frame until you reach your target.</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <li>You are now ready to perform the hidden RNG manipulation. Back out to the main pause menu and hold a direction on the joystick toward your clear path in the grass.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Unpause the game by closing the menu. This will cause the player to take steps in the grass, triggering the hidden encounter. This should appear as a speech bubble with a red <code class="fw-bold">!</code>.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>If you planned to swap out your lead Pok&eacute;mon for a Synchronize lead, you can do so now if you open the pause menu right away.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Quickly initiate the encounter before it despawns and verify the result matches expectations. Spawned hidden encounters disappear within a few seconds.</li>
