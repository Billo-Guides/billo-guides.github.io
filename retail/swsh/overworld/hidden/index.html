    Worked examples for manipulating Hidden encounters in any weather condition.

<hr />

<p class="fw-bold" style="color: #c00000;">HIDDEN RNG SHOULD ONLY BE USED IF NO OTHER OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE FOR YOUR TARGET POK&Eacute;MON, PICK A DIFFERENT ENCOUNTER TYPE WHERE POSSIBLE. HIDDEN RNG MAY TAKE MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS BEFORE HITTING A RESULT!</p>

<p>Hidden spawners generate different species of Pok&eacute;mon from an encounter table. A random number from 0 to 99 determines the encounter slot. The encounter tables are weather-dependent and remain the same until the weather in the area changes. Since the weather can change if the console date rolls past midnight (00:00), consider setting your system time before starting to avoid unexpected RNG advancements and Pok&eacute;mon spawns.</p>

            <li>In the main window, enter your TID/SID, select your game version, and check the Shiny/Mark Charm checkboxes if these items are present in your save file.</li>
            <li>Click <code class="fw-bold">Encounter Lookup</code> in the top toolbar to open a subwindow. Enter the desired species name in the search field and select a HIDDEN encounter.</li>
            <li>Close the <code class="fw-bold">Encounter Lookup</code> window, then input the relevant <code class="fw-bold">Location</code>, <code class="fw-bold">Weather</code>, and <code class="fw-bold">Species</code> information into the <code class="fw-bold">Encounter Settings</code> section.</li>
            <li>Select your <code class="fw-bold">Lead Ability</code> and <code class="fw-bold">Max Step</code>. We recommend that you use an ability that boosts the rate of triggering a hidden encounter and a Max Step count of 1.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The abilities Arena Trap, Illuminate, and No Guard increase the chance of hidden encounters appearing.</li>
                <li>If you still wish to benefit from Synchronize and feel brave, it is possible to quickly switch the lead Pok&eacute;mon after the hidden encounter is spawned and before the battle has been triggered.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Adjust your search range using the <code class="fw-bold">+</code> field in <code class="fw-bold">Encounter Settings</code>, then configure additional search filters such as Shiny, Marks, IVs, or Height.</li>

        <ol>
            <li>Remove any Pok&eacute;mon stored in either {% include tooltips/nursery.html %}.</li>
            <li>Prepare your party so you have the correct lead Pok&eacute;mon and any catchers you plan to use.</li>
            <li>If you opened the Pok&eacute;dex at any point, such as when checking your KO count, this will generate Pok&eacute;dex Recommendations which alter the RNG. You should perform a date skip, reset the game to before you opened the Pok&eacute;dex, or account for it in the program.</li>
            <li>Make sure your current console date has the correct <a class="clickable-link">weather condition<a> to spawn your Pok&eacute;mon.</li>
            <li>Go to the the area where your target Pok&eacute;mon can be found.</li>
            <li>Find the largest patch of grass in the area and position yourself at one end where you have a clear path to run.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If wild Pok&eacute;mon nearby are aggressive, try one of the following:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If there are not many aggressive Pok&eacute;mon, you can despawn them until they are replaced with less aggressive Pok&eacute;mon.</li>
                    <li>Change the weather to one with fewer aggressive Pok&eacute;mon and run around to populate the field with them. The spawned Pok&eacute;mon will remain even if the weather is changed.</li>
                    <li>If you know that a Pok&eacute;mon of a certain type is not aggressive and it can be type-pulled, you can use a type-pull lead to populate the field.</li>
                    <li>Reposition until the Pok&eacute;mon that spawn in are not aggressive.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Note that if you leave the area for advancements, you will have to redo this step upon returning. Make sure you have plenty of time to reposition if you choose to advance elsewhere.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Dismount from your bike. Hidden encounters are less likely to appear while riding a bike, even with an optimal lead ability.</li>
            <li>Save the game.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Unless you are in Glimwood Tangle, you will have to deal with extra wild Pok&eacute;mon wandering the overworld, which can cause unwanted advances when trying to hit a target frame. Your goal should be to have as many non-aggressive Pok&eacute;mon on the field. We will discuss how to limit wandering later in the guide.</p>

<hr />

<p>The instructions for hitting a target frame depend on the selected weather condition. Rain/Thunderstorm are considered "advanced" and may be challenging for beginners. If this is your first time attempting this type of RNG manipulation, we recommended you start with a different weather condition to familiarize yourself with the general process.</p>
