<p>This section explains how to RNG abuse Pokémon from Hidden encounters on retail hardware. It covers the entire process, from choosing a location to obtaining the desired Pokémon.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #b60606;">From here it is assumed that you have read the initial page of this guide and have a general idea of how to use SWSH OWRNG Generator GUI, as well as understanding how to find and monitor your seed.</span></p>

    <span class="fw-bold text-light">About Hidden Encounters:</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Hidden Encounter Spawn Mechanics</span></h6>
    
    <p>Hidden encounters are NOT guaranteed to produce the same species every time, the species is instead derived from the encounterslot value (0-99), the Pokémon that occupy encounterslots will vary depending on weather and location.</p>

    <p>Spawning a hidden encounter is down to chance, the game essentially checks to see if it is possible to spawn a patch of shaking grass per step taken in long grass. For this reason hidden encounter RNG as a whole is inconsistent.</p>

    <p>Having spawned wild Pokemon in the overworld (which will be present in most cases) will add another layer of inconsistency, as this causes random frame advancements. Pick a different encounter type whenever possible, such as static or symbol.</p>

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Dex Recommendations & Ability Boosts</span></h6>

    <p>Dex recommendations can be found by opening the Pokedex, when a Pokémon is recommended the encounterslot value for that specific Pokémon is boosted. Storm Drain, Lightning Rod & Harvest abilities will also boost the encounterslot value of Pokémon of the corrisponding type (e.g Harvest boosts grass types).</p>

    <p>Neither of these boosting methods are supported in the RNG tool at this point in time, avoid using them as this will produce inaccurate results.</p>

  </div>
</div><br>

<p><span class="fw-bold">With all the required reading out of the way, begin by configuring the RNG tool and standing in the correct position in-game.</span></p>

    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Tool Setup:</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg"> 
    <ol>
      <li>Open SWSH_OWRNG_Generator_GUI, then type your 5 digit TID/SID into the correct fields of the main window (for shiny Pokémon only).</li><p></p>
      <li>Open the <code span class="fw-bold">Encounter Lookup</code> sub window, then type the species name of the Pokémon you plan to RNG abuse, select an appealing hidden encounter.</li><p></p>
      <li>Confirm that the filters have been set properly inside the Main Window, encounter filters can be found on the left-hand side.</li><p></p>
      <li>Set your search filters inside the middle portion of the Main Window. You can filter for specific Marks, IVs, Shininess, etc.</li>
    </ol>

    <blockquote><span class="fw-bold">Example -</span> Encounter Lookup specifies Glimwood Tangle in any weather for Sinistea-Antique, this information has been automatically filled inside the main window. The search filters were also manually configured to search for a Shiny with any mark.</blockquote>

    <p>For Hidden encounters, stand directly next to a grass patch in the area, the smaller the grass patch, the better.</p>

    <p>The location in the above image is ideal: Minimal NPCs, no extra spawned Pokémon, and standing directly next to (within 1 step of) a patch of grass.</p>

    <p>Glimwood Tangle is notably "quiet" and has no overworld weather. Remember, advancement speed (aka noise) depends on location, NPC count, and weather. There are also no overworld spawns in the grass patches in this area, which will provide more stability.</p>

    <blockquote>If you can't find a good spot, knock out any static spawns blocking your path. They will remain despawned until you return to the area after a date change.</blockquote>

<hr /><div class="title" style="background-color: #0c0038;">
  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">The Process</h1>
</div><hr />

<p>The end goal is to spawn the patch of shaky grass on the calculated target frame provided by the generator search results. Once a hidden encounter patch spawns in the overworld, its stats and details are fixed. Hidden encounters disappear within a few seconds, so there is little room for error.</p>

<p>Ensure your encounter and search filters are properly configured before continuing (see Figure 1). The advancement methods used to achieve the result are listed in the table found on the main page.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #b60606;">Hidden encounters in areas that contain overworld Pokémon can be very difficult on retail hardware, strongly consider picking a different type of encounter if one is available.</p>

<p>You cannot search for targets without knowing your current seed. This is achieved by using the <code span class="fw-bold">Retail Seed Finder</code> window, usage of this window was covered on the main page.</p>

  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>After identifying seeds using the <code span class="fw-bold">Retail Seed Finder</code>, a Shiny Sinistea can be found on advance 3451-3453. Target frames can often appear in clusters, which are multiple frames in a row (or close to each other) that produce the same end result.</p>

    <p>Due to having multiple frames that can potentially produce your desired Pokemon, searching for clusters is ideal. You may wish to keep searching for target frames until a cluster appears.</p>

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Undesirable result?</span></h6>
    <ol>
      <li>Save in the correct position, then close and re-open the game to refresh the seed.</li>

<p>You may need to calculate the rough delay for the encounter. Doing this step will provide the best possible chances of hitting your target frame. Delay is the difference in advancements between spawning the Pokémon in the overworld and the actual frame the Pokémon was generated on.</p>

    <h6 span class="fw-bold">Step-by-step:</h6>
    <ol>
      <li>Re-identify the current seed if you have lost track. Click the <code class="fw-bold">Update States</code> button on the main window after doing so.</li><p></p>
      <li>Open the <code class="fw-bold">Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> sub window, type the number of NPCs into the <code class="fw-bold">NPCs</code> field, then search. Take note of the amount of frames that will be consumed from closing the pause menu (inside the <code class="fw-bold">Jump</code> column).</li><p></p>
      <li>Unpause the game, then run into the grass patch, if a hidden encounter spawns within 1-3 steps, encounter and capture it. Then use an IV calculator to determine the IVs.</li><p></p>
      <li>If the Pokémon encountered does not match your target species, use the <code class="fw-bold">Encounter Lookup</code> to fill in the details of the Pokémon you encountered.</li><p></p>
      <li>Find the advance that generated the Pokémon in the search results, then subtract the amount of frames that were consumed from the pause menu. This will be the delay for this encounter.</li>
    </ol>

    <blockquote><span class="fw-bold">Example -</span> If the Pokémon was generated on frame 10, and 7 frames were consumed from closing the pause menu, this means the delay for this encounter is 3.</blockquote>

        <li>Pause the game and re-identify your current seed, then click the <code span class="fw-bold">Update States</code> button to reflect the new RNG state inside the main window and search for your target again.<p></p>
        <li>Subtract the delay from the actual target frame (e.g <code span class="fw-bold">1000 (target) - 3 (delay) = 997</code>) this will set the new target frame and this will be the frame to spawn the Pokémon on.</li><p></p>
        <li>Open the <code span class="fw-bold">Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> tab, and enter the number of NPCs calculated earlier into the <code span class="fw-bold">NPCs</code> field, then click <code class="fw-bold">Search</code>.</li><p></p>

        <li>Perform some animation advancements according to the number inside the <code span class="fw-bold">Init Adv.</code> field. For example, do 5 advancements if the number inside the field is 5.</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>In extreme cases you will not be able to reach your target frame using menu close prediction. To counter this, aim to get as close as possible to your target using menu close prediction, then use player movement advances to hit your target frame.</blockquote>

      <ul>
        <li>Open and close the pause menu until a single menu close lands you onto the target frame (do any required movement advancements here if you do not land directly onto the target frame).</li><p></p>
        <li>Unpause the game, then run into the grass and attempt to spawn a hidden encounter, if a grass patch spawns within 3 steps, initiate the encounter to confirm the result matches what is expected.</li><p></p>
