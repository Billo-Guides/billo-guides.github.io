           <ul>
           <li>Fishing, much like symbol encounters, are not guaranteed to be the same species every time, the Pokémon species is instead based on an encounterslot value of 0-99.</li><br />
           <li>Aiming for clustered frames gives you a higher chance of hitting targets. A cluster is a group of frames that produce the same end result.</li><br />
           <li>Having any Pokémon with the ability Syncronize in the first slot of your party will guarantee that the nature of any encountered overworld Pokémon will be the same as your leading Pokémon. </li><br />
           <li>Test how fast the RNG state naturally advances in the area of your target Pokémon, consider locations with calm weather to reduce instability.</li><br />
           <li>You should knock out any unwanted static spawns if they are blocking your path.</li>

        Find the Pokédex entry of the Pokémon you are hunting and enter the total number of KOs into the <code>KO Count:</code> field of the main window. This number is important in order to get accurate results from the generator.<br /> <br />

        Brilliant Aura guarantees 2 full 31 IVs. Players who desire high IV wild caught Pokémon may wish to filter for Brilliant Aura.<br /><br />

</div>
  <hr />
The goal is to spawn a fishing pool on the calculated target frame given by the generator. The advancement methods used are listed in detail on the main page of this guide.<br /><br />

We will be aiming for a Shiny, marked Whiscash with a Brilliant Aura in Slumbering Weald. You can be more specific with the filters if you wish, such as filtering for a specific mark, specific IVs, or Brilliant Aura.<br /><br />

<details>
  <summary><u>Using Whiscash as the example:</u></summary>
  <ul>
     <li>The <code>Encounter Lookup</code> tab tells us that Whiscash has an encounter slot range of 0-59, a level range of 45-47 and is a fishing encounter in all weather in Slumbering Weald. It also tells us Whiscash does not hold a random item and has 4 potential Egg Moves.<br /></li>
     <li>After clicking the row of our choice, we can see all the information about the encounter listed on the left hand side of the main window.</li>
     <li>The Pokedex displays a <code>Number Battled:</code> value of 500 for Whiscash, this needs to be entered into the <code>KO: Count</code> field of the generator.</li>
     <li>We are paused in-game, and our current seeds are visible on the main window after clicking <code>Connect</code>.</li>
     <li>Now all the details of our encounter are set up properly and we are ready to search or targets!</li>
  </ul>
</details><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Awesome, everything looks good!</span> Our TID/SID and the details of the encounter have been entered into the main window. Time to find an ideal position to stand in-game and set the correct weather condition.<br /><br />

    </div>
    <div class="card-body" style="background-color: #ffffff36;">
      This location in Slumbering Weald is ideal, there are no NPCs around and there are no spawned Pokémon present.<br /><br />

      Once a fishing pool is spawned in the overworld, the stats and internal details (such as PID/EC) of the Pokemon inside are generated and set in stone. This is why it is only important to spawn the fishing pool in the overworld on the correct frame, and to not let a target Pokémon despawn!<br /><br />

      Once the main window is filled in correctly & you are standing in a good position in-game, you can begin to identify your current seed.

<img src="./images/fishing/figure-3-seed-identification-fishing.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

You cannot search for targets without knowing your current seed. This is achieved by using the <code>Retail Seed Finder</code> window pictured above.<br /><br />

<div class="accordion" id="SeedIdentification">

    </div>
    <div class="card-body" style="background-color: #ffffff36;">

      <span class="fw-bold">How to identify current seeds using the Retail Seed Finder:</span><br /><br />
      <ol>
        <li>Open the <code>Retail Seed Finder</code> window and open the pause menu in-game.</li><br />
        <li>Open the Pokemon party menu, select a Pokemon, then click summary.</li><br />
        <li>Begin making your Pokemon animate by using the <code>L3</code> button, take note of the type of animation. (Physical or special).</li><br />
        <li>If the animation was physical, click the <code>(0)Physical</code> button, if the animation was special, click the <code>(1)Special</code> button.<br /><br />
        If you don't feel like clicking the button, you can use your keyboard too! Simply type <code>0</code> or <code>,</code> for a physical animation, and <code>1</code> or <code>.</code> for a special animation.</li><br />
        <li>Repeat this process 128 times, if done correctly your current seeds will now be visible on-screen. Click <code>Update Main Form</code>. At this stage it is safe to close the Retail Seed Finder window.</li><br />
        <li>After identifying your current seed you can now begin searching for target frames!</li>
      </ol><hr />

      <span class="fw-bold">How to re-identify current seeds using the Retail Advances Tracker:</span><br /><br />
      <ol>
        <li>Click the <code>Generate Pattern</code> button on the main window after identifying your current seed.</li><br />
        <li>Open the Pokemon party menu, select a Pokemon, then click summary.</li><br />
        <li>Record 10-20 animations until you are left with 1 result.</li><br />
        <li>Click <code>Update States</code> after doing so to input your new current seed into the <code>State[0]</code> and <code>Stete[1]</code> fields automatically.</li><br />
        <li>Search for your target frame again and confirm the seed re-identification was correct.</li>
      </ol>

      <details>
        <summary><span class="fw-bold">Seed Identification Troubleshooting:</span><br /></summary>
      <div class="card-body" class="text-light" style="background-color: #0c0038;">
        If you do not find a result after re-identification, or your target frame disappears, this is because either:<br /><br />
        <ul>
          <li>The initial seed identification (using the <code>Retail Seed Finder</code>) was incorrect. Which is a result of not recording the animations properly.</li>
          <li>The re-identification animations were not recorded properly, and produced an invalid result.</li>
        </ul>
        To resolve this you will need to re-identify your current seed from the start, pay close attention to the sequence of animations to avoid producing incorrect results!<br /><br />

        Seed re-identification plays a big role in advancing towards a target frame, and also helps to find out how many advancements will occur from a specific in-game action.</details>

<span class="fw-bold">We found one!</span> A shiny, Jolly natured Whiscash in a cluster on advances 792-801. These are the "target frames" and the aim will be to spawn the fishing pool on any of these frames.<br /><br />

  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Advancing Towards A Target!</h1>
</div>
<hr />

The generator displays the target on frame 792-801, based on local testing the delay for this fishing encounter is 3. This means our target remains on frame 792-801.<br /><br />

      </h5>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body" style="background-color: #ffffff36;">

      <span class="fw-bold">Step-by-step tutorial:</span><br /><br />
      <ol>
        <li>Advance towards your target frame using any of the methods listed inside the table on <a href="https://billo-guides.github.io/retail/swsh/overworld">main page of this guide</a>. Consider day skipping to advance large distances.</li><br />
      
        <li>Once you are within a few thousand frames of your target, stand near to the spawn point of a fishing pool in the area of the Pokémon you are hunting.</li><br />
      
        <li>Pause the game using the <code>X</code> button, re-identify your current seed using the <code>Retail Advances Tracker</code>, then search for your target again.</li><br />

        <div class="card-body" class="text-light" style="background-color: #0c0038;">
        From this point it's recommended to only advance using <code>menu close & animations</code> as they only advance in small increments, making them easy to keep track of. You should also dismount your bike at this point.
       </div><br />

        <li>Open the <code>Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> window and work out the amount of NPCs that are in the area, (NPC calculation is explained on the <a href="https://billo-guides.github.io/retail/swsh/overworld">main page</a> if you are unsure.) Take note of this number as you will need it later.</li><br />

        <li>Re-identify your current seed once again. You should be roughly a few hundred frames away from the target at this stage.</li> <br /> 
          
        <li>Open the <code>Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> window again and enter your target frame & amount of NPCs into the correct fields then search again.</li><br /> 
        
        <div class="card-body" class="text-light" style="background-color: #0c0038;">
        If you are unable to find your target frame in the search results, this means the target cannot be hit based on your seed. This can be resolved using animations to advance the RNG state slightly, then searching again. <br /><br />

          <details>
            <summary><u>How To:</u><br /></summary>
          <ol>
            <li>Open the Pokemon summary screen and press the <code>L3</code> button to advance the RNG state by a single frame.</li>
            <li>Open the main window, and set the IV/Shiny/Mark filters to the default settings.</li>
            <li>Set the search radius to a small amount, then press search.</li>
            <li>You should now be able to see (and track) your current seed (<code>State0</code> and <code>State1</code> based on your search results.</li>
            <li>Enter your new current seed, target frame, and the amount of NPCs calculated earlier into the <code>Retail Menu Advances Viewer</code> window, and search again.</li>
          </ol>
        </details>
       </div><br />

        <li>Use animations to advance to the a point where closing the pause menu once will land directly onto your target frame, according to the <code>Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> prediction.</li><br />
      
        <li>Close the pause menu and walk around to spawn a fishing pool (without letting the stick rest, as this will advance the RNG state) then initate an encounter! Confirm you have hit the expected result.</li><br />

      <div class="card-body" class="text-light" style="background-color: #0c0038;">
       You can be creative with the methods you use to advance the RNG state. Menu close prediction is not necessary but will make for a much easier time hitting target frames and is extremely helpful in areas of the game where the RNG advances at a quick pace.
