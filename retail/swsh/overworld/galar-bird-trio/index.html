</div>

<hr />

If you made it this far, it must mean you have an interest in RNG abusing the galarian bird trio, Articuno, Zapdos and Moltres! This page will cover the whole process, from finding a desirable location to achieving a final result.<br /> <br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Getting Started:</span></h3>
<u>Before starting, do the following:</u>
<ul>
  <li>Open the GUI and click on the <code>Encounter Lookup</code> button at the top of the main window. This will open the Encounter Lookup tab.</li>
  <li>Type the species name of the Pokémon you are hunting into the empty field, this will bring up a list of every possible encounter for that Pokémon.</li>
  <li>Scroll down the list of encounters and click on the row that matches your weather condition, this will automatically enter the information into the main window.</li>
  <li>Enter your 5 digit TID/SID into the fields on the main window, select <code>Shiny Charm</code> & <code>Mark charm</code> if you have them present in your save file.</li>
  <li>All of the birds are shiny locked and have 3 guaranteed IVs, click the <code>Shiny Locked</code> checkbox and set the IV count to 3.</li>
  <li>Head to the location in-game, change the date until you meet the correct weather condition, then stand near to a patch of grass in the area.</li>
  <li>Head to the location of the bird in-game in-game and save.</li>
</ul>

<u>You must have also met the following in-game requirements:</u>
<ul>
  <li>Have the legendary birds roaming in each of the Wild Areas by completing the Crown Tundra main quest.</li>
  <li>Unlock a fly point in each of the areas. Snowslide Slope (Articuno) East Lake Axewell (Zapdos) Fields of honor (Moltres) are recommended.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Identifying your current seeds:</span></h3>
It's impossible to search for results without knowing the current seeds, you can identify your current seed through the <code>Retail Seed Finder</code> window of the generator, open it and begin recording your sequence of animations.<br /><br />

<u>Identifying your current seed using Retail Seed Finder:</u>
<ol>
  <li>Open the game and enter the overworld.</li>
  <li>Pause the game using <code>X</code>, click <code>Pokémon</code>, then view the summary of any of your Pokémon.</li>
  <li>Open the <code>Retail Seed Finder</code> window and have your Pokémon animate.</li>
  <li>Click (or type) <code>0</code> if your animation was physical.</li>
  <li>Click (or type) <code>1</code> if your animation was special.</li>
  <li>Repeat this process 128 times and your seed will be generated. Click <code>Update Main Form</code> and exit back to the main window.</li>
  <li>Search for a target frame.</li>
</ol>

This can seem like a lengthy and tedious process at first glance (it kinda is), for this reason it's advised to remap your controller button layout if you are able to do so, such as remapping the <code>L3</code> button to <code>Y</code>. This is done through the Switch system settings.<br /><br />

Once you know your seed you can easily re-identify your current state within 10-20 animations, this is done using the <code>Retail Advances Tracker</code> feature found on the main window.<br /><br />

<u>Re-identifying your current RNG states using the Retail Advances Tracker:</u>
<ol>
  <li>Click <code>Generate Pattern</code> once you have found your seeds using <code>Retail Seed Finder</code>.</li>
  <li>Pause the game using <code>X</code>, click <code>Pokémon</code>, then view the summary of any of your Pokémon and have it do some animations.</li>
  <li>Click (or type) <code>0</code> if your animation was physical.</li>
  <li>Click (or type) <code>1</code> if your animation was special.</li>
  <li>Repeat roughly 10-20 times until you are given 1 possible result. Click <code>Update States</code> to automatically paste your new seeds into the correct fields.</li>
  <li>Search for your target again. If you see your target on the generator again that means the original seed identification was correct and you can continue following the guide.</li>
  <li>If you cannot find your original target this means seed identification was incorrect and needs to be redone.</li>
</ol>

Seed re-identification plays a huge role, it helps us keep track of the amount of frame advancements between searches. This is extremely helpful for closing in on a specific target frame or finding out how many advancements a specific action achieves.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">With all the required reading out of the way, it's time to get started!</span><br /><br />

<hr />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Time to get to work!</span></h3>
The goal is to fly into the location of our desired bird on the calculated target frame given by the generator. The advancement methods used are listed on the main page of this guide.<br /><br />

The birds are guaranteed to spawn in the Wild Areas once you complete the requirements to have them roaming. Their internal details will be set in stone until you leave the area, this means we can use fly or leave the area to regenerate the IVs/Nature/Mark of our bird if we miss our target frame.<br /><br />

The delay for each of the birds varies. It's recommended to take a few practice attempts and note down your delay for the highest chances of being able to hit the target frame. See the <code>Troubleshooting Encounters</code> section at the bottom of this page if you are running into problems with delay calculation.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold" style="color:#C1A9CA;">Articuno</span><br />
<span class="fw-bold">Location:</span> Crown Tundra<br />
<span class="fw-bold">Recommended fly point:</span> Snowslide Slope<br />
<span class="fw-bold">Recommended starting delay:</span> 130-140<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold" style="color:#E76236;">Zapdos</span><br />
<span class="fw-bold">Location:</span> Wild Area (Meetup Point/Motostoke Area)<br />
<span class="fw-bold">Recommended fly point:</span> East Lake Axewell<br />
<span class="fw-bold">Recommended starting delay:</span> 20-30<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold" style="color:#DE2B5C;">Moltres</span><br />
<span class="fw-bold">Location:</span> Isle of Armor<br />
<span class="fw-bold">Recommended fly point:</span> Master Dojo<br />
<span class="fw-bold">Recommended starting delay:</span> 60-80<br /><br />

We will be aiming for a 5IV marked Zapdos in this example. You can be more specific with the filters if you wish, such as filtering for a specific mark or specific IVs.<br /><br /> 

The process for RNG abusing each of the birds is the same. You will simply fly to the correct location depending on which of the birds you are hunting.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Awesome, everything looks good!</span> Our TID/SID and the details of the encounter have been entered into the main window. Time to find an ideal position to stand in-game and set the correct weather condition.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 2 -</span> Game setup<br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 3 -</span> Recommended Fly Points<br />
<img src="./images/galar-bird-trio/figure-3-fly-points.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br />

<u>These three fly points are suggested as they're close to the spawn point of each of the birds, meaning we can encounter them more quickly.</u><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 4 -</span> Seed identification<br />
<img src="./images/galar-bird-trio/figure-4-seed-identification-bird.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />
  
After recording 128 animations the seed will be generated, clicking <code>Update Main Form</code> will automatically paste the information into the correct field of the main wndow.<br /><br />
  
Once the main window is filled in correctly, you've identified your current seeds & you are stood in a good position in-game, you can begin looking for target frames by clicking the search button on main window of the generator.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">If your results are not desirable, you will need to reset the game and identify your current seeds again.</span><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 5 -</span> Target found!<br />
<img src="./images/galar-bird-trio/figure-5-static-search-bird.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">We found one!</span> A shiny, x natured Zapdos-Galar in a cluster on advances x-y. These are the "target frames" and the aim will be to spawn Zapdos in the overworld on any of these frames by flying into the area.<br /><br />

Once the bird is spawned in the overworld the stats and internal details (such as PID/EC) are generated and set in stone, this is why it is only important to fly in and spawn the bird in the overworld on the correct frame. <span class="fw-bold">Don't fly away after you spawn it in the overworld!</span><br /><br />

It's common to see "clusters" or "groups" of frames that produce the same result when searching for a target. Aiming for large clusters is recommended as this will provide more chances for the player to spawn the Pokémon on the correct frame.<br /><br />

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Advancing towards the target:</span></h5>
The generator displays the target on frame x-y, based on local testing the delay for this hidden encounter is 30. This means we will aim to walk into the grass on frame x-y.<br /><br />

<u>Step by step:</u><br />
<ol>
  <li>Advance towards the target frame using bike, NPCs or by spawning overworld Pokémon in the area.</li><br />
If your target is a large number of frames away consider using the day skipping method described on the main page of this guide.<br /><br />

  <li>Once you believe you are close to the target (within ~500 frames), re-identify your current seed.</li><br />
Re-identify your current seed using the Pokémon summary screen, <u>not</u> by using the party menu.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">From this point it's recommended to only advance using menu close, animation and bike advancements as they only advance in small increments, making them easy to keep track of.</span><br /><br />

  <li>Open and close the map, re-identify your current seed and pay attention to the number of advancements that have passed, repeat this step roughly 5 times.</li><br />
It's important to know the average number of frames that will advance from opening the map, we will eventually need to account for this to hit the correct target frame.<br /><br />

  <li>Advance closer to your target frame (within ~100 frames this time) and open the pause menu again, open the Pokémon summary page and re-identify your current seed once more.</li><br />
You should also have a calculator available to use to keep track of inputs/advancements.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">From this point it's recommended to only advance using animations from the <u>party menu</u>, this provide a stable +1 advancement per input.</span><br /><br />

  <li>Open the party menu and advance to your target frame, you can use a calculator to keep track of inputs. Here's where we need to factor in the amount of advances that pass from closing the pause menu and the delay of the area.</li><br />
For example, if we have a base delay of 30, and 2 frames advance from closing the map (average) and the target was 100 advances away, we would advance to frame 68 (100-30-2) using animations, then opening the map and flying into position should pick up the 32 advancements we need to hit the target frame.<br /><br />

  <li>Open the map and fly to the location of your desired bird. Encounter/capture it and make sure it matches the output shown on the generator.</li><br />
Remember not to let it despawn! If you missed your target frame you can retry, the birds will regenerate once you leave and re-enter the area.<br />
</ol>

You can be creative with the methods you use to advance the RNG state.<br /><br />

<img src="./images/galar-bird-trio/figure-6-static-hit-bird.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

By using animations and a standard calculator to keep track of inputs, we were able to hit out target frame!<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">The Zapdos-Galar matches the output of the generator, mission accomplished!</span><br /><br />

Espeon in party slot 1 with the ability Syncronize was used to determine the nature, using a Pokémon with this ability will make the nature of any overworld Pokémon match the nature of yours.<br /><br />

Different areas & environments can have a drastic influence on delay, if you are missing targets when you believe you should be finding results, you should consider reading the Troubleshooting Encounters section down below.<br /><br />

<hr />

<div class="bg-secondary title">
  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Troubleshooting Encounters</h1>
</div>

<hr />

This section covers how to troubleshoot encounters and delays. If you keep missing targets or can't find your result on the generator at all, this is the place to be.<br /><br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Missing Targets:</span></h3>
<u>The commonly occuring reasons for missing a target Pokémon are:</u>
<ul>
  <li>Encounter spawned too early/late due to mistiming.</li>
  <li>There is a delay left unaccounted for.</li>
  <li>Information in the main window was not completely accurate.</li>
</ul>

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Encounter spawned too early or too late...</span></h5>

This is a common issue players will face when tackling this hunt as the delay is variable and not always consistent. Retry and search for a new target frame, take note of your delays on each attempt and go for the one you are hitting most often.<br /><br />

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Troubleshooting delay...</span></h5>

For the purposes of this guide, the term "delay" is used to describe the frame difference between the Pokémon we encountered and the frame the encounter was initiated on.<br /><br />

Delay Calc - <code>frame Pokemon was generated - frame encounter was initiated = delay</code><br /><br />

We can use an IV calculator to confirm the exact frame the encounter was generated on and calculate the delay from there. Here's how it's done!
<ul>
  <li>Aim for a target, such as any marked legendary bird.</li>
  <li>Take a practice attempt and fly into the target. Take note of the frame you initiated fly.</li>
  <li>Encounter the Pokémon and capture it, then calculate the exact IVs using an IV calculator such as the <a href="https://www.serebii.net/games/iv-calcswsh.shtml">this one by Serebii</a>.</li>
  <li>If you didn't find the Pokémon that you expected, search for the specific IVs of the result you found and find the frame you hit.</li>
  <li>Subtract your the frame you initiated fly from the frame you actually hit.</li>
  <li>This will be your delay for that particular encounter.</li>
</ul>

Once you have noted down a few delays aim for targets once again, this time factoring in the delay you noted down. For example if we hit a delay of 30, our final A press will be 30 frames before the result you can see on the generator.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 8 -</span> Delay troubleshooting example<br />
<img src="./images/galar-bird-trio/figure-8-troubleshooting-encounters.jpg" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

We encountered an Zapdos, but it doesn't have the IVs we expected! So what happened here? Well... We miscalculated. Let's try to find the frame we actually hit.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 9 -</span> Calculating the IVs<br />
<img src="./images/galar-bird-trio/figure-9-calculating-IVs.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

Using an IV calculator we can find the IVs of the Zapdos-Galar we hit and use this information to locate the exact frame we landed on according to the generator.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 10 -</span> Finding the frame<br />
<img src="./images/galar-bird-trio/figure-10-locating-frame.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

By filtering for IVs we can see the frame that generated the Zapdos, it was 1 frame behind where we wanted to be, oh well! We will adjust accordingly for next time by spawning it in the overworld 1 frame later.<br /><br />

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Cannot find result...</span></h5>
If you cannot find the Pokémon you are in battle with anywhere on the tool this is likely due to one of two reasons:
<ul>
  <li>Losing track of advancements.</li>
  <li>The information entered into the main window of the tool was not completely accurate.</li>
</ul>

Double check the information on the main tab is entered correctly by searching it on the Encounter Lookup and clicking the correct row. <br /><br />

<u>You must pay attention to the row you are clicking and making sure it matches your in-game environment.</u><br /><br />

That's all there is to it!<br /><br />
