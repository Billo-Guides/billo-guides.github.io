<p>This guide explains how to RNG abuse Pokémon from Roaming encounters (Galarian Articuno, Zapdos & Moltres). It covers the entire process, from choosing a location to obtaining the desired Pokémon.</p>

<p>Each bird spawns in one of the Wild Area, Articuno can be found in Crown Tundra, Zapdos can be found in base Wild Area, and Moltres can be found in the Isle of Armor, you must complete the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CgHPreHUJQ">Crown Tundra main quest</a> to spawn these encounters in the overworld.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #b60606;">From here it is assumed that you have read the initial page of this guide and have a general idea of how to use SWSH OWRNG Generator GUI.</span></p>

  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <ol>
      <li>Open SWSH_OWRNG_Generator_GUI, then click on the <code span class="fw-bold">Encounter Lookup</code> button at the top of the window to open the Encounter Lookup tab.</li><p></p>
      <li>Type the species name into the empty search field to bring up a list of encounters for that specific Pokémon. Select a row that appeals to you by left clicking it.</li><p></p>
      <li>Confirm that the filters have been set properly inside the Main Window, encounter filters can be found on the left-hand side.</li><p></p>
      <li>Set your search filters inside the middle portion of the Main Window. You can filter for specific Marks, IVs, Nature, etc.</li><p></p>
      <li>Fly to the correct location in game and save.</li>
    </ol>

    <blockquote>Avoid rain or thunderstorm when picking an encounter where possible, rain causes advancements to occur at an extreme rate, making it difficult to hit target frames.</blockquote>

<h6><span class="fw-bold">Using Zapdos-Galar as the example:</span></h6>
<p>The Encounter Lookup specifies the base Wild Area in any weather for this encounter. Clicking the row of the table automatically fills in all of the relevant encounter information on the left-hand side of the main window.</p>

<p>The search filters, in the middle of the main window, were manually configured to search for any Zapdos-Galar with any mark and 5 significant IVs, you can be more specific with the filters if you wish. Do note that these encounters cannot be shiny.</p>
   
<hr /><div class="title" style="background-color: #0c0038;">
  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">The Process</h1>
</div><hr />

<p>The end goal is to fly into the area that contains our chosen bird at the perfect time, to spawn it on the calculated target frame provided by the generator search results. Once a roaming bird spawns in the overworld, its stats and details are fixed until you reload the area.</p>

<p>Ensure your encounter and search filters are properly configured before continuing (see Figure 1). The advancement methods used to achieve the result are listed in the table found on the main page.</p>

<div class="card-body card-bg">
  <p>These three fly points are suggested as they're close to the spawn point of each of the birds, meaning we can encounter them more quickly. This is helpful as it may take several attempts to spawn the bird on the correct frame.</p>

  <p>Unlock the above fly points, and have your party Pokemon ready for battle, you can use a Pokemon with the ability Syncronize in the first slot of your party to determine the nature of the encountered bird.</p>

  <p>Once you have the fly points unlocked, fly to the area that contains your chosen bird then save the game.</p>

<p>You cannot search for targets without knowing your current seed. This is achieved by using the <code span class="fw-bold">Retail Seed Finder</code> window. If you did not read the section of the main page that covers how to find and monitor your seed, go back and do this now.</p>

<p>After searching a desired result, we've found a Scowling Marked Zapdos-Galar in a cluster on advances 2441-2445 Target frames often appear in clusters, which are multiple frames in a row yield the same result. A larger cluster increases your chances of hitting the target frame.</p>

<details>
  <summary><span class="fw-bold">Undesirable result?</span></summary>
  <ol>
    <li>Disconnect from the program, and restart the game to refresh the seed.</li>
    <li>Enter the overworld, pause the game, then reconnect to the program.</li>
    <li>Search for a new target frame, repeat this process until a desirable result shows in the generator search results.</li>

  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Advancing Towards the Target!</h1>
</div><hr />

<p>First, you will need to calculate the rough delay for the encounter. Doing this step will provide the best possible chances of hitting your target frame. Delay is the difference in advancements between spawning the Pokémon in the overworld and the actual frame the Pokémon was generated on.</p>

<div class="card border-dark">
  <div class="anchored card-header" style="background-color: #0c0038;" id="delay-calculation-cfw">
    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Delay Calculation</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <h6 span class="fw-bold">Delay Calculation</h6>
    <ol>
      <li>When standing at the recommended fly point of your desired bird, pause the game and begin identifying your current seed.</li><p></p>
      <li>Open the map without closing the pause menu, then fly into the area that contains your chosen bird.</li><p></p>
      <li>Chase it down and initiate the encounter, capture the Pokémon so that you can view the IVs/Nature more accurately.</li><p></p>
      <li>After capturing the Pokémon, enter the stats into any IV calculator to get a rough idea of the IVs of the Pokémon you hit. Also take note of the nature of the Pokémon you found.</li><p></p>
      <li>Find the Pokémon you hit in the search results of the GUI, this should be relatively close to your start frame. Check to see which advancement generated your Pokémon.</li><p></p>
      <li>Subtract the amount of advancements that were consumed by identifying your current seed, if this is your initial identification this will be 128.</li><p></p> 
      <li>This will be your delay for this encounter, for example, if it took 128 advancements to identify your seed, and your bird was generated on advancement 160, your delay would be 32 (128+32=160).</li><p></p>
      <li>Since delay is variable for roaming encounters, it is recommended to repeat this process a few times to get a rough average delay that is consistent for you.</li>
    </ol>

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Recommended starting delays:</span></h6>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="fw-bold" style="color:#C1A9CA;">Articuno</span> - 130-140</li>
      <li><span class="fw-bold" style="color:#E76236;">Zapdos</span> - 20-30</li>
      <li><span class="fw-bold" style="color:#DE2B5C;">Moltres</span> - 60-80</li>
    </ul>

   </div>
 </div><br>

 <p>Take note of the calculated delay, you will need this information in order to reach the correct target frame later. Do not change your fly point after calculating the delay, as this is subject to change depending on positioning.</p>

    <div class="card-body" style="background-color: #ffffff36;">

      <span class="fw-bold">Step-by-step tutorial:</span><br /><br />
      <ol>
        <li>Advance towards your target frame using any of the methods listed inside the table on <a href="https://billo-guides.github.io/retail/swsh/overworld">main page of this guide</a>. Consider day skipping to advance large distances.</li><br />
      
        <li>Once you are within a few hundred frames of your target, stand in a quiet location.</li><br />
      
        <li>Pause the game using the <code>X</code> button, re-identify your current seed using the <code>Retail Advances Tracker</code>, then search for your target again.</li><br />

        <div class="card-body" class="text-light" style="background-color: #0c0038;">
        From this point it's recommended to only advance using <code>animations</code> as they only advance in small increments, making them easy to keep track of. <br /><br />

        It's also recommended to have one Pokemon on your party to decrease the amount of advancements that will occur from opening the map from the pause menu.
       </div><br />

        <li>Open and close the map, and re-identify your current seed. Take note of how many advances occur from doing so, repeat this step multiple times and take an average number from the results.</li><br />
        
        <li>Open the party menu and advance to your target frame using animations, here's where we need to factor in the amount of advances that pass from closing the map.</li><br />

        <div class="card-body" class="text-light" style="background-color: #0c0038;">
          <span class="fw-bold">Example:</span> If your target frame is on advance 100, the generation delay is 30, and the average amount of advancements from opening the town map is 2, we will need to open the town map on advance 68 in order to hit the target frame. (68+2+30=100)
       </div><br />
      
       <li>Open the map and fly into the area to spawn your bird! Encounter and capture it to confirm you hit your target frame.</li><br />
          
       <div class="card-body" class="text-light" style="background-color: #0c0038;">
        You can be creative with the methods you use to advance the RNG state. The above method is the recommended method that provides the most consistency of hitting target frames for roaming encounters.
