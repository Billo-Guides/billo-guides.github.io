<p>This guide explains how to RNG abuse Pokémon from Symbol encounters. It covers the entire process, from choosing a location to obtaining the desired Pokémon.</p>

<p>Symbol encounters aren't guaranteed to be the same species each time. The species is determined by an encounter slot value of 0-99, which changes with the weather. The weather can change every day at midnight (00:00). Be mindful of the Switch system time to avoid spawning unexpected Pokémon due to incorrect weather conditions.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #b60606;">From here it is assumed that you have read the initial page of this guide and have a general idea of how to use SWSH OWRNG Generator GUI, as well as understanding how to find and monitor your seed.</span></p>

<p>The Encounter Lookup specifies Slippery Slope with Overcast weather for this encounter. Clicking the row of the table automatically fills in all of the relevant encounter information on the left-hand side of the main window.</p>

<p>KO Count has been manually configured to match the amount displayed in Swablus PokeDex entry for my save file (500 KOs applies maximum Brilliant Aura bonus).</p>

<p>The search filters, in the middle of the main window, were manually configured to search for any shiny with any mark, you can be more specific with the filters if you wish, such as filtering for IVs/Nature.</p>

      <h6><span class="fw-bold">The KO mechanic & Brilliant Aura</span></h6>
      <p>The KO Mechanic provides a boost to the rates of Shiny & Brilliant Aura Pokémon, you can find the correct value by opening the Pokedéx screen of the Pokémon you are hunting. You can find more details about the odds boosts on <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Brilliant_Pok%C3%A9mon#Appearance_rate">Bulbapedia</a>.</p>

      <p>Brilliant Aura boosts the amount of guaranteed 31 IVs a Pokémon has, only Pokémon from symbol encounters can have this trait. This makes symbol encounters ideal for those who are hunting for high IV wild Pokémon.</p><hr />

      <h6><span class="fw-bold">Pokémon Behaviours</span></h6>
      <p>Pokémon have different behaviour classes, some will be aggressive and target the player, others will be relaxed, and in some cases the Pokemon will be timid and flee when they notice the player. Pokémon with flee behaviour need to be encountered quickly before they escape.</p>

      <u>Pokemon with flee behaviour:</u><br>
      <p>Butterfree, Vulpix, Chansey, Horsea, Dunsparce, Blissey, Ralts, Whismur, Drilbur, Audino, Trubbish, Zorua, Ferroseed, Inkay, Phantump, Noibat, Wimpod, Skwovet & Silicobra.</p><hr />

      <h6><span class="fw-bold">Dex Recommendations & Ability Boosts</span></h6>

      <p>Dex recommendations can be found by opening the Pokedex, when a Pokemon is recommended the encounterslot value for that specific Pokemon is boosted.</p>

      <p>Abilities like Lightning Rod, Harvest & Storm Drain boost the encounterslot value for Pokemon of specific types.</p>

      <p>Both of these boosting methods are NOT accounted for inside SWSH_OWRNG_Generator_GUI. Avoid using Dexrec or ability boosts in case of inaccuracies.</p>

  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">The Process</h1>
</div><hr />

<p>The end goal is to spawn the Pokémon on the calculated target frame provided by the generator search results. Once a Pokémon spawns in the overworld, its stats and details are fixed.</p>

<p>Ensure your encounter and search filters are properly configured before continuing (see Figure 1). The advancement methods used to achieve the result are listed in the table found on the main page.</p>

  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>For Symbol encounters, stand where there is a clear, straight line between you and the target Pokémon. Avoid areas that trigger other Wild/Static spawns. Once you have good positioning, calibrate your NPC count.</p>

    <p>The location in the above image is ideal: Minimal NPCs, no extra spawned Pokémon, and a clear line to the target patch of grass.</p>

    <p>Slippery Slope, in the Crown Tundra Wild Area, is notably "quiet" in calm weather. Remember, advancement speed (aka noise) depends on location, NPC count, and weather. The more quiet the area, the better.</p>

    <blockquote>If you can't find a good spot, knock out any static spawns blocking your path. They will remain despawned until you return after a date change.</blockquote>

<p>After searching a desired result, we've found a shiny, Lax natured Phantump in a cluster on advances 2016-2020. Target frames often appear in clusters, which are multiple frames in a row yield the same result. A larger cluster increases your chances of hitting the target frame.</p>

<details>
  <summary><span class="fw-bold">Undesirable result?</span></summary>
  <ol>
    <li>Disconnect from the program, and restart the game to refresh the seed.</li>
    <li>Enter the overworld, pause the game, then identify your current seed again.</li>
    <li>Search for a new target frame, repeat this process until a desirable result shows in the generator search results.</li>
  </ol>
</details><p></p>

<p>Once you have found a good position, have calibrated the NPC count, and found a desirable result, you can continue following the guide.</p>


<hr /><div class="title" style="background-color: #0c0038;">
  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Advancing Towards the Target!</h1>
</div><hr />

<p>First, you will need to calculate the rough delay for the encounter. Doing this step will provide the best possible chances of hitting your target frame. Delay is the difference in advancements between spawning the Pokémon in the overworld and the actual frame the Pokémon was generated on.</p>

  <div class="anchored card-header" style="background-color: #0c0038;" id="delay-calculation-retail">
    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Delay Calculation</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>From here it is assumed you already know how to calibrate your NPC count, if you do not know how to do this, go back to the main page.</p>
    
    <h6 span class="fw-bold">Delay Calculation</h6>
    <ol>
      <li>Stand in an ideal in-game position with a clear line between you and your target Pokémon, you should be standing far enough away for it to be despawned.</li><p></p>
      <li>Calculate the number of NPCs at this stage if you have not already done so, then open the <code class="fw-bold">Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> sub window.</li><p></p>
      <li>Type the number of NPCs into the <code class="fw-bold">NPCs</code> field, and click search. This will provide you with the correct <code class="fw-bold">Jump</code> value.</li><p></p>
      <li>With the game still paused, re-identify your current seed using the <code class="fw-bold">Retail Advances Tracker </code> on the main window, update the states and perform a filterless search.</li><p></p>
      <li>Unpause the game, run towards the spawn point of your target Pokémon, then initiate the encounter, keep in mind the amount of advances that were consumed from closing the pause menu.</li><p></p>
      <li>Catch the Pokémon, then enter the stats into any IV calculator to get a rough idea of the IVs of the Pokémon you hit. Also take note of the nature of the Pokémon you found.</li><p></p>
      <li>Find the Pokémon you hit in the search results of the GUI, this should be relatively close to your start frame. Check to see which advancement generated your Pokémon.</li><p></p>
      <li>Subtract the amount of advancements that were consumed by closing the pause menu, this figure will then be your delay for this particular encounter.</li><p></p> 
    </ol>

    <blockquote><span class="fw-bold">Example:</span> If the Pokémon was generated on frame 10, and 7 frames were consumed from closing the pause menu, this means the delay for this encounter is 3.</blockquote>

   </div>
 </div><br>

 <p>At this stage you should now know have calibrated both the NPC count and the delay for the encounter, take note of both of these values as they are significantly important for hitting target frames consistently.</p>

    <div class="card-body card-bg">
      <h6 class="fw-bold">Step-by-step tutorial:</h6>

      <ul>
        <li>Advance towards your target frame using any method listed in the table on the main page (consider date-skipping for long distance-advancements).</li><p></p>
        <li>Return to the correct position in-game when you are a few thousand frames away from the desired target. Ensure the target is despawned.</li><p></p>
        <li>Set the weather condition in the area you are hunting in if necessary, by changing the Switch system time BACKWARDS to avoid unwanted advancements.</li><p></p>
        <li>Pause the game, then re-identify your current seed. Press the search button again to set a new target frame.</li><p></p>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>At this stage, we recommend using menu close prediction & animation advancements for accurate, small, and manageable advancement increments.</blockquote>

      <ul>
        <li>Open the Menu Close Advances Viewer tab, and enter the number of NPCs calculated earlier in the <code span class="fw-bold">NPCs</code> field.</li><p></p>
        <li>Enter your target frame into the empty <code span class="fw-bold">+</code> field, factor in your calibrated delay (e.g <code span class="fw-bold">1000 (target) - 3 (delay) = 997 (new target)</code>).</li><p></p>
        <li>Hit search, you should now see a list of frames in the table, see if your exact target frame, great! This means menu close prediction can be used to hit it.</li><p></p>
        <li>If you do not see your target frame in the search results, use animation advancements to increment the RNG state by 1, then repeat the above steps until visible.</li><p></p>
      </ul>

      <blockquote><p>If you are nudging the RNG state, you will need to grab your seed from the main window search results. It should be relatively simple enough to track your seed this way using animations.</p>

      <p>In rare cases, you may not be able to hit the desired frame using menu close prediction alone. Use it to get as close as possible, then use movement advances to reach your target instead.</blockquote>

      <ul>
        <li>Open and close the pause menu until a single menu close lands you onto (or as close as possible) the target frame.</li><p></p>
        <li>Unpause the game, then move towards the spawn point of your desired Pokémon to spawn it in the overworld grass as quickly as possible.</li><p></p>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>If you do not land directly onto your target frame, this is the point where you should use movement advancements, do so before spawning your desired Pokémon in the overworld.</blockquote>

      <ul>
        <li>Initiate the encounter to check if you've hit the correct target frame. If the result is unexpected, recalibrate your NPC count and delay, make sure KO count was set correctly, then retry. Be quick to spawn your Pokémon in the overworld to avoid overshooting.</li>
