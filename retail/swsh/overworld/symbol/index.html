<hr />

If you made it this far, it must mean you have an interest in RNG abusing Pokémon from symbol encounters! This page will cover the whole process, from finding a desirable location to achieving a final result.<br /> <br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Getting Started:</span></h3>
<u>Before starting, do the following:</u>
<ul>
  <li>Open the GUI and click on the <code>Encounter Lookup</code> button at the top of the main window. This will open the Encounter Lookup tab.</li>
  <li>Type the species name of the Pokémon you are hunting into the empty field. This will bring up a list of every possible encounter for that Pokémon.</li>
  <li>Scroll down the list of encounters and click on one of the rows displaying a SYMBOL encounter. This will automatically enter the information into the main window.</li>
  <li>Enter your 5 digit TID/SID into the fields on the main window, select <code>Shiny Charm</code> & <code>Mark charm</code> if you have them present in your save file.</li>
  <li>Head to the location in-game, change the date until you meet the correct weather condition, then stand near to a patch of grass in the area.</li>
  <li>Run far enough away to despawn the Pokémon and save, then press the <code>X</code> button to pause the game.</li>
</ul>

It's suggested to pick an encounter in a quiet area with calm weather to reduce instability. Noise is area specific, you should test how noisy an area is before attempting to RNG abuse Pokémon in it.<br /> <br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">The KO mechanic:</span></h3>
This references the <code>Number Battled:</code> screen of the Pokédex and is used to boost the odds of (Shiny) Brilliant Aura Pokémon. You are able to view the total amount of KO'd Pokémon per species in your entire save file.<br /> <br />

Find the Pokédex entry of the Pokémon you are hunting and enter the total number of KOs into the <code>KO Count:</code> field of the main window. This number is important in order to get accurate results from the generator.<br /> <br />

Brilliant Aura guarantees 2 full 31 IVs. Players who desire high IV wild caught Pokémon may wish to filter for Brilliant Aura.<br /><br />

Want to know the odds based on the total amount of KOs? <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Brilliant_Pok%C3%A9mon">This article on Bulbapedia</a> will tell you everything you need to know.<br /> <br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Identifying your Current Seeds:</span></h3>
It's impossible to search for results without knowing the current seeds. You can identify your current seed through the <code>Retail Seed Finder</code> window of the generator. Open it and begin recording your sequence of animations.<br /><br />

<u>Identifying your current seed using Retail Seed Finder:</u>
<ol>
  <li>Open the game and enter the overworld.</li>
  <li>Pause the game using <code>X</code>, click <code>Pokémon</code>, then view the summary of any of your Pokémon.</li>
  <li>Open the <code>Retail Seed Finder</code> window and have your Pokémon animate by pressing the <code>L3</code> button.</li>
  <li>Click (or type) <code>0</code> if your animation was physical.</li>
  <li>Click (or type) <code>1</code> if your animation was special.</li>
  <li>Repeat this process 128 times and your seed will be generated. Click <code>Update Main Form</code> and exit back to the main window.</li>
  <li>Search for a target frame.</li>
</ol>

This can seem like a lengthy and tedious process at first glance (it kinda is), and for this reason it's advised to remap your controller button layout if you are able to do so, such as remapping the <code>L3</code> button to <code>Y</code>. This is
done through the Switch system settings.<br /><br />

Once you know your seed you can easily re-identify your current state within 10-20 animations. This is done using the <code>Retail Advances Tracker</code> feature found on the main window.<br /><br />

<u>Re-identifying your current RNG states using the Retail Advances Tracker:</u>
<ol>
  <li>Click <code>Generate Pattern</code> once you have found your seeds using <code>Retail Seed Finder</code>.</li>
  <li>Pause the game using <code>X</code>, click <code>Pokémon</code>, then view the summary of any of your Pokémon and have it do some animations.</li>
  <li>Click (or type) <code>0</code> if your animation was physical.</li>
  <li>Click (or type) <code>1</code> if your animation was special.</li>
  <li>Repeat roughly 10-20 times until you are given 1 possible result. Click <code>Update States</code> to automatically paste your new seeds into the correct fields.</li>
  <li>Search for your target again. If you see your target on the generator again that means the original seed identification was correct and you can continue following the guide.</li>
  <li>If you cannot find your original target this means seed identification was incorrect and needs to be redone.</li>
</ol>

Seed re-identification plays a huge role, it helps us keep track of the amount of frame advancements between searches. This is extremely helpful for closing in on a specific target frame or finding out how many advancements a specific action
achieves.<br /><br />

The generator does not currently provide support for mechanics that boost the encounter rates of specific Pokémon. This includes Dexrec boosts or abilities like Storm Drain. Using spawn boosters like these may output incorrect results.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">With all the required reading out of the way, it's time to get started!</span><br /><br />

<hr />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Time to Get to Work!</span></h3>
The goal is to walk towards the grass and spawn the Pokémon on the calculated target frame given by the generator. The advancement methods used are listed in detail on the main page of this guide.<br /><br />

We will be aiming for a Shiny, marked Phantump with a Brilliant Aura in Slippery Slope. You can be more specific with the filters if you wish, such as filtering for a specific mark or specific IVs.<br /><br />

<u>Using Phantump as the example:</u><br />
- The <code>Encounter Lookup</code> tab tells us that Phantump has an encounter slot range of 90-99, a level range of 60-65 and is a symbol encounter in overcast weather. It also tells us Phantump does not hold a random item and has 3 potential Egg
Moves.<br />
- Clicking the row that applies to our encounter will enter all the information we need into the main window.<br />
- Our Pokédex tells us we have >500 KOs on Phantump.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Let's enter this information into the main window by clicking the row that matches our conditions!</span><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 1 -</span> Tool setup<br />
<img src="./images/symbol/figure-1-encounter-lookup-symbol.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Awesome, everything looks good!</span> Our TID/SID and the details of the encounter have been entered into the main window. Time to find an ideal position to stand in-game and set the correct weather condition.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 2 -</span> Game setup<br />
<img src="./images/symbol/figure-2-in-game-setup.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<u>This location in Slippery Slope is ideal, there are no NPCs around and there are no spawned Pokémon present.</u><br /><br />

Slippery Slope is located within the Crown Tundra, which is a notably quiet area in calm weather conditions.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 3 -</span> Seed identification<br />
<img src="./images/symbol/figure-3-seed-identification-symbol.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

After recording 128 animations the seed will be generated. Clicking <code>Update Main Form</code> will automatically paste the information into the correct field of the main window.<br /><br />

Once the main window is filled in correctly, you've identified your current seeds, and you are stood in a good position in-game, you can begin looking for target frames by clicking the search button on main window of the generator.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">If your results are not desirable, you will need to reset the game and identify your current seeds again.</span><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 4 -</span> Target found!<br />
<img src="./images/symbol/figure-4-symbol-search.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">We found one!</span> A shiny, Lax natured Phantump in a cluster on advances 2016-2020. These are the "target frames" and the aim will be to spawn Phantump in the grass on any of these frames.<br /><br />

Once a Pokémon is spawned in the overworld the stats and internal details (such as PID/EC) are generated and set in stone. This is why it is only important to spawn the Pokémon in the overworld on the correct frame.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Don't let the Pokémon despawn after you spawn it in the overworld!</span><br /><br />

It's common to see "clusters" or "groups" of frames that produce the same result when searching for a target. Aiming for large clusters is highly recommended as this will provide more chances for the player to spawn the Pokémon on the correct
frame.<br /><br />

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Advancing towards the target:</span></h5>
The generator displays the target on frame 2016-2020, based on local testing the delay for this symbol encounter is 3. This means we will aim to walk into the grass on frame 2013-2017.<br /><br />

<u>Step by step:</u><br />
<ol>
  <li>Advance towards the target frame using bike, NPCs or by spawning overworld Pokémon in the area.</li><br />
  Consider using the date skipping technique to advance large distances.<br /><br />

  <li>Once you believe you are within a few hundred frames of your target, stand near to the spawn point of the Pokémon you are hunting, then pause the game with X.</li><br />

  <span class="fw-bold">From this point it's recommended to only advance using menu close, animation and bike advancements as they only advance in small increments, making them easy to keep track of.</span><br /><br />

  <li>Re-identify your current seed using the <code>Retail Advances Tracker</code>. Remember to click the <code>Update States</code> button after re-identification!<br /><br />
  You should be relatively close to your target frame at this stage and ideally the game should be paused to avoid any unwanted advancements.<br /><br />
  
  <li>Open the <code>Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> window and work out the amount of NPCs that are in the area, then enter your target frame into the <code>+</code> field of this window and hit search.</li><br />
  This can be used to accurately predict the number of advancements that occur from closing the pause menu, as explained on the <a href="https://billo-guides.github.io/retail/swsh/overworld">main page</a>.<br /><br />

  <span class="fw-bold">From this point it's recommended to only advance using menu close prediction, you can also use party animation advancements to nudge the frames forward one at a time if you need to.</span><br /><br />
  
  An example of a good time to use animations to nudge frames forward is when you are unable to find your target frame on the <code>Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> window, or need to advance small distances. (Each animation is a stable +1 advancement.)<br /><br />

  <li>Open and close the pause menu until closing the menu a single time lands onto your target frame, according to the <code>Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> prediction.</li><br />
  Pay close attention to how many times you have closed and re-opened the pause menu to avoid overshooting your target.<br /><br />

  <li>Close the pause menu and quickly run towards towards the grass to spawn your target Pokémon! Encounter and capture it, make sure all the internal details match the output shown on the generator.</li><br />
  Remember not to let it despawn!<br />
</ol>

You can be creative with the methods you use to advance the RNG state. Menu close prediction is not necessary but will make for a much easier time hitting target frames and is extremely helpful in the more noisy areas of the game.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 5 -</span> Target Frame Hit!<br />
<img src="./images/symbol/figure-5-symbol-hit.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

By using animations and a standard calculator to keep track of inputs, we were able to hit out target frame!<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 6/7 -</span> Result Found!<br />
<img src="./images/symbol/figure-6-symbol-in-battle.jpg" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />
<img src="./images/symbol/figure-7-symbol-summary-screen.jpg" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">The Phantump matches the output of the generator, mission accomplished!</span><br /><br />

Espeon in party slot 1 with the ability Syncronize was used to determine the nature, using a Pokémon with this ability will make the nature of any overworld Pokémon match the nature of yours.<br /><br />
