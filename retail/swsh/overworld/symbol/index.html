</div><hr />

<p>This section explains how to RNG abuse Pokémon from Symbol encounters on retail hardware. It covers the entire process, from choosing a location to obtaining the desired Pokémon.</p>

<div class="card border-dark">
  <div class="anchored card-header" style="background-color: #0c0038;" id="understanding-symbol-encounters-retail">
    <span class="fw-bold text-light">About Symbol Encounters:</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Symbol spawners are NOT guaranteed to produce the same species every time, the species is instead derived from the encounterslot value (0-99), the Pokémon that occupy encounterslots will vary depending on weather and location.</p>

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Brilliant Aura Mechanics</span></h6>
    <p>Symbol encounters can potentially spawn Pokémon with Brilliant Aura, which boosts the amount of guaranteed max IVs the Pokémon will have. Players searching for high IV targets may opt for manipulating Symbol encounters for this purpose.</p>

    <p>Brilliant Aura Pokémon can also have increased shiny odds, which is based on the Pokedex KO count. This value can be seen by viewing the Pokedex entry of any Pokémon. <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Brilliant_Pok%C3%A9mon#Appearance_rate">Bulbapedia</a> contains useful information about the increased rates.</p>

    <p>For maximum optimization with this encounter type, it is recommended to have access to the Shiny Charm and have 500 KOs on the Pokémon you are hunting, this is a time consuming process however.</p>
    <hr />

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Pokemon Behaviour Mechanics</span></h6>
    <p>Pokémon have different behaviour classes, some will be aggressive and target the player, others will be relaxed, and in some cases the Pokémon will be timid and flee when they notice the player, causing them to despawn entirely. Pokémon with flee behaviour need to be encountered quickly before they escape.</p>

    <u>Pokémon with flee behaviour:</u><br>
    <p>Butterfree, Vulpix, Chansey, Horsea, Dunsparce, Blissey, Ralts, Whismur, Drilbur, Audino, Trubbish, Zorua, Ferroseed, Inkay, Phantump, Noibat, Wimpod, Skwovet & Silicobra.</p>
    
    <p>If the Pokémon you intend to hunt appears in this list, take note and proceed with caution when attempting to hit your target frame.</p>
    <hr />

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Dex Recommendations & Ability Boosts (NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORTED)</span></h6>

    <p>Dex recommendations can be found by opening the Pokedex, when a Pokémon is recommended the encounterslot value for that specific Pokémon is boosted. Storm Drain, Lightning Rod & Harvest abilities will also boost the encounterslot value of Pokémon of the corrisponding type (e.g Harvest boosts grass types).</p>

    <p>Neither of these boosting methods are supported in the RNG tool at this point in time, avoid using them as this will produce inaccurate results.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold">With all the required reading out of the way, begin by configuring the RNG tool and standing in the correct position in-game.</span></p>

  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg"> 
    <ol>
      <li>Open SWSH_OWRNG_Generator_GUI, then type your 5 digit TID/SID into the correct fields of the main window (for shiny Pokémon only).</li><p></p>
      <li>Open the <code span class="fw-bold">Encounter Lookup</code> sub window, then type the species name of the Pokémon you plan to RNG abuse, select an appealing symbol encounter.</li><p></p>
      <li>Confirm that the filters have been set properly inside the Main Window, encounter filters can be found on the left-hand side.</li><p></p>
      <li>Set the correct KO count inside the assigned field on the left, this should match the value displayed by the Pokedex for the Pokémon being hunted.</li><p></p>
      <li>Set your search filters inside the middle portion of the Main Window. You can filter for specific Marks, IVs, Shininess, etc.</li>
    </ol>

    <blockquote><span class="fw-bold">Example -</span> Encounter Lookup specifies Slippery Slope in overcast weather for Swablu, this information has been automatically filled inside the main window. The KO count for Swablu according to the Pokedex is 500, and the search filters were also manually configured to search for a Shiny Swablu with any mark.</blockquote>

    <p>For Symbol encounters, stand where there is a clear, straight line between you and the target Pokémon. Avoid areas that trigger other Wild/Static spawns. Once you have good positioning, calibrate your NPC count.</p>

    <p>The location in the above image is ideal: Minimal NPCs, no extra spawned Pokémon, and a clear line to the target patch of grass that contains the target Pokémon.</p>

    <p>Slippery Slope, in the Crown Tundra Wild Area, is notably "quiet" in calm weather. Remember, advancement speed (aka noise) depends on location, NPC count, and weather. The more quiet the area, the better.</p>

    <blockquote>If you can't find a good spot, knock out any static spawns blocking your path. They will remain despawned until you return after a date change.</blockquote>

<p>After searching a desired result, we've found a shiny, Lax natured Phantump in a cluster on advances 2016-2020. Target frames often appear in clusters, which are multiple frames in a row yield the same result. A larger cluster increases your chances of hitting the target frame.</p>

<details>
  <summary><span class="fw-bold">Undesirable result?</span></summary>
  <ol>
    <li>Disconnect from the program, and restart the game to refresh the seed.</li>
    <li>Enter the overworld, pause the game, then identify your current seed again.</li>
    <li>Search for a new target frame, repeat this process until a desirable result shows in the generator search results.</li>
  </ol>
</details><p></p>

<p>Once you have found a good position, have calibrated the NPC count, and found a desirable result, you can continue following the guide.</p>


<hr /><div class="title" style="background-color: #0c0038;">
  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Advancing Towards the Target!</h1>
</div><hr />

<p>First, you will need to calculate the rough delay for the encounter. Doing this step will provide the best possible chances of hitting your target frame. Delay is the difference in advancements between spawning the Pokémon in the overworld and the actual frame the Pokémon was generated on.</p>

<div class="card border-dark">
  <div class="anchored card-header" style="background-color: #0c0038;" id="delay-calculation-retail">
    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Delay Calculation</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>From here it is assumed you already know how to calibrate your NPC count, if you do not know how to do this, go back to the main page.</p>
    
    <h6 span class="fw-bold">Delay Calculation</h6>
    <ol>
      <li>Stand in an ideal in-game position with a clear line between you and your target Pokémon, you should be standing far enough away for it to be despawned.</li><p></p>
      <li>Calculate the number of NPCs at this stage if you have not already done so, then open the <code class="fw-bold">Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> sub window.</li><p></p>
      <li>Type the number of NPCs into the <code class="fw-bold">NPCs</code> field, and click search. This will provide you with the correct <code class="fw-bold">Jump</code> value.</li><p></p>
      <li>With the game still paused, re-identify your current seed using the <code class="fw-bold">Retail Advances Tracker </code> on the main window, update the states and perform a filterless search.</li><p></p>
      <li>Unpause the game, run towards the spawn point of your target Pokémon, then initiate the encounter, keep in mind the amount of advances that were consumed from closing the pause menu.</li><p></p>
      <li>Catch the Pokémon, then enter the stats into any IV calculator to get a rough idea of the IVs of the Pokémon you hit. Also take note of the nature of the Pokémon you found.</li><p></p>
      <li>Find the Pokémon you hit in the search results of the GUI, this should be relatively close to your start frame. Check to see which advancement generated your Pokémon.</li><p></p>
      <li>Subtract the amount of advancements that were consumed by closing the pause menu, this figure will then be your delay for this particular encounter.</li><p></p> 
    </ol>

    <blockquote><span class="fw-bold">Example:</span> If the Pokémon was generated on frame 10, and 7 frames were consumed from closing the pause menu, this means the delay for this encounter is 3.</blockquote>

   </div>
 </div><br>

 <p>At this stage you should now know have calibrated both the NPC count and the delay for the encounter, take note of both of these values as they are significantly important for hitting target frames consistently.</p>

    <div class="card-body card-bg">
      <h6 class="fw-bold">Step-by-step tutorial:</h6>

      <ul>
        <li>Advance towards your target frame using any method listed in the table on the main page (consider date-skipping for long distance-advancements).</li><p></p>
        <li>Return to the correct position in-game when you are a few thousand frames away from the desired target. Ensure the target is despawned.</li><p></p>
        <li>Set the weather condition in the area you are hunting in if necessary, by changing the Switch system time BACKWARDS to avoid unwanted advancements.</li><p></p>
        <li>Pause the game, then re-identify your current seed. Press the search button again to set a new target frame.</li><p></p>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>At this stage, we recommend using menu close prediction & animation advancements for accurate, small, and manageable advancement increments.</blockquote>

      <ul>
        <li>Open the Menu Close Advances Viewer tab, and enter the number of NPCs calculated earlier in the <code span class="fw-bold">NPCs</code> field.</li><p></p>
        <li>Enter your target frame into the empty <code span class="fw-bold">+</code> field, factor in your calibrated delay (e.g <code span class="fw-bold">1000 (target) - 3 (delay) = 997 (new target)</code>).</li><p></p>
        <li>Hit search, you should now see a list of frames in the table, see if your exact target frame, great! This means menu close prediction can be used to hit it.</li><p></p>
        <li>If you do not see your target frame in the search results, use animation advancements to increment the RNG state by 1, then repeat the above steps until visible.</li><p></p>
      </ul>

      <blockquote><p>If you are nudging the RNG state, you will need to grab your seed from the main window search results. It should be relatively simple enough to track your seed this way using animations.</p>

      <p>In rare cases, you may not be able to hit the desired frame using menu close prediction alone. Use it to get as close as possible, then use movement advances to reach your target instead.</blockquote>

      <ul>
        <li>Open and close the pause menu until a single menu close lands you onto (or as close as possible) the target frame.</li><p></p>
        <li>Unpause the game, then move towards the spawn point of your desired Pokémon to spawn it in the overworld grass as quickly as possible.</li><p></p>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>If you do not land directly onto your target frame, this is the point where you should use movement advancements, do so before spawning your desired Pokémon in the overworld.</blockquote>

      <ul>
        <li>Initiate the encounter to check if you've hit the correct target frame. If the result is unexpected, recalibrate your NPC count and delay, make sure KO count was set correctly, then retry. Be quick to spawn your Pokémon in the overworld to avoid overshooting.</li>
