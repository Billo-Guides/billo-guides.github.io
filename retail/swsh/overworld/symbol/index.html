<hr />

If you made it this far, it must mean you have an interest in RNG abusing Pokémon from symbol encounters! This page will cover the whole process, from finding a desirable location to achieving a final result.<br /> <br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Getting Started:</span></h3>
<u>Before starting, do the following:</u>
<ul>
  <li>Open the GUI and click on the <code>Encounter Lookup</code> button at the top of the main window. This will open the Encounter Lookup tab.</li>
  <li>Type the species name of the Pokémon you are hunting into the empty field, this will bring up a list of every possible encounter and has all the information you need for the main window.</li>
  <li>Scroll down the list of encounters and click on one of the rows displaying a symbol encounter, this will automatically enter the information into the main window.</li>
  <li>Enter your 5 digit TID/SID into the fields on the main window, select <code>Shiny Charm & Mark charm</code> if you have them present in your save file.</li>
  <li>Head to the location in-game, change the date until you meet the correct weather condition, then stand near to a patch of grass.</li>
  <li>Run far enough away to despawn the Pokémon and save, then press the X button to pause the game.</li>
</ul>

When searching possible encounters it is suggested to pick an encounter in a quiet area with calm weather to reduce the amount of noise significantly. Noise is area specific, and it is recommended to test how much noise an area has to avoid overshooting the target.<br /> <br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">The KO mechanic:</span></h3>
This references the <code>Number Battled:</code> screen of the Pokédex and is used to boost the odds of (Shiny) Brilliant Aura Pokémon. On this screen you are able to view the total amount of KO'd Pokémon per species in your entire save file.<br /> <br />

Brilliant Aura guarantees 2 full 31 IVs, players who desire high IV wild caught Pokémon may wish to filter for Brilliant Aura.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">The number of Pokémon battled is important to symbol encounters and needs to be entered into the tool manually or you will not get accurate results from the generator!</span> Check the amount of KOs you have on the Pokemon you are hunting before starting.<br /> <br />

Want to know the odds based on the total amount of KOs? <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Brilliant_Pok%C3%A9mon">This article on Bulbapedia</a> will tell you everything you need to know.<br /> <br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Day Skipping:</span></h3>
If you plan to use the day skipping exploit to advance the RNG state, you should take a moment to monitor your advances to avoid overshooting. Skip 1 day at a time and reidentify your current seed to get a rough estimate of how many frames will advance per day skipped.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Day skipping will change the weather in the area!</span> Be sure to set your date back to how it was originally to restore the weather condition.<br /><br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Identifying your current seeds:</span></h3>
It's impossible to search for results without knowing the current seeds, this is done through the <code>Retail Seed Finder</code> tab of the generator. Click the Retail Seed Finder button at the top of the main window and begin recording your sequence of animations.<br /><br />

<u>Step-by-step instructions for identifying your current RNG states:</u>
<ul>
  <li>Open the game and enter the overworld.</li>
  <li>Pause the game using X, click "Pokémon", then view the summary of any of your Pokémon.</li>
  <li>Open the Seed Finder tab of the GUI and have your Pokémon animate.</li>
  <li>Click (or type) 0 if your animation was physical.</li>
  <li>Click (or type) 1 if your animation was special.</li>
  <li>Repeat this process 128 times and your seed will be generated. Click <code>Update Main Form</code> and exit back to the main window.</li>
</ul>

This can seem like a lengthy and tedious process at first glance (it kinda is), for this reason it's advised to remap your controller button layout if you are able to do so, such as remapping L3 to Y. This is done through the Switch system settings.<br /><br />

Once you know your seed you can easily re-identify your current state within 10-20 animations, this is done using the <code>Retail Advances Tracker</code> feature on the main window of the generator.<br /><br />

<u>Re-identifying your current RNG states using the Retail Advances Tracker:</u>
<ul>
  <li>Click <code>Generate Pattern</code> once you have found your seeds using Seed Finder.</li>
  <li>Pause the game using X, click "Pokémon", then view the summary of any of your Pokémon and have it do some animations.</li>
  <li>Click (or type) 0 into the field if your animation was physical.</li>
  <li>Click (or type) 1 into the field if your animation was special.</li>
  <li>Repeat roughly 10-20 times until you are given 1 possible result. Click <code>Update States</code> to automatically paste your new seeds into the correct fields.</li>
</ul>

Seed re-identification plays a huge role, it helps us keep track of the amount of advancements that have happened between searches. This is extremely helpful for closing in on a specific target frame or finding out how many advancements a specific action achieves.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">With all the required reading out of the way, it's time to get started!</span><br /><br />

<hr />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Time to get to work!</span></h3>
The goal is to walk towards the grass and spawn the Pokémon on the calculated target frame given by the generator. The advancement methods used are listed in detail on the main page of this guide.<br /><br />

<u>The generator does not currently provide support for mechanics that boost the encounter rates of specific Pokémon, such as Dexrec boosts or abilities like Storm Drain. Using spawn boosters like these may output incorrect results.</u><br /><br />

We will be aiming for a Shiny, marked Phantump with a Brilliant Aura in Slippery Slope. You can be more specific with the filters if you wish, such as filtering for a specific mark or specific IVs.<br /><br />

<u>Using Phantump as the example:</u><br />
- The <code>Encounter Lookup</code> tab tells us that Phantump has an encounter slot range of 90-99, a level range of 60-65 and is a symbol encounter in overcast weather. It also tells us Phantump does not hold a random item and has 3 potential Egg Moves.<br />
- Clicking the row that applies to our encounter will enter all the information we need into the main window.<br />
- Our Pokédex tells us we have >500 KOs on -pokemonnamehere-.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Let's enter this information into the main window by clicking the row that matches our conditions!</span><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 1 -</span> Tool setup<br />
<img src="./images/symbol/figure-1-encounter-lookup-symbol.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Awesome, everything looks good!</span> Our TID/SID and the details of the encounter have been entered into the main window. Time to find an ideal position to stand in-game and set the correct weather condition.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 2 -</span> Game setup<br />
<img src="./images/symbol/figure-2-in-game-setup.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<u>This location in Slippery Slope is ideal, there are no NPCs around and there are no spawned Pokémon present.</u> Slippery Slope is located within the Crown Tundra which is a notably quiet area in calm weather conditions.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 3 -</span> Seed identification<br />
<img src="./images/symbol/figure-3-seed-identification-symbol.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />
  
After recording 128 animations the seed will be generated, clicking <code>Update Main Form</code> will automatically paste the information into the correct field of the main wndow, <span class="fw-bold">don't forget to do this before exiting the <code>Retail Seed Finder</code> tab!</span><br /><br />
  
Once the main window is filled in correctly, you've identified your current seeds & you are stood in a good position in-game, you can begin looking for target frames by clicking the search button on main window of the generator.<br /><br />

<u>If your results are not desirable, you will need to close the game and identify your current seeds again using the <code>Retail Seed Finder</code> tab.</u><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure  4 -</span> Target found!<br />
<img src="./images/symbol/figure-4-symbol-search.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">We found one!</span> A shiny, Lax natured Phantump in a cluster on advances 2016-2020. These are the "target frames" and the aim will be to spawn Phantump in the grass on any of these frames.<br /><br />

Once a Pokémon is spawned in the grass the stats and internal details (such as PID/EC) are generated and set in stone, this is why it is only important to spawn the Pokémon in the overworld on the correct frame. <span class="fw-bold">Don't let the Pokémon despawn after you spawn it in the overworld!</span><br /><br />

It's common to see "clusters" or "groups" of frames that produce the same result when searching for a target. Aiming for large clusters is recommended as this will provide more chances for the player to spawn the Pokémon on the correct frame.<br /><br />

<u>Advancing towards the target (Step-by-step example):</u><br />
<ul>
  <li>The target is 2016-2020 advances away, based on local testing the delay for this symbol encounter is 2, this means the aim will be to walk into the grass 2 frames earlier than the target frame displayed on the generator.</li>
  <li>Advance towards the target frame using bike, NPCs or using other spawned overworld Pokémon in the area. You can use DaySkip to advance large distances quickly too!</li>
  <li>Once you believe you are close enough to a target (within ~500 frames), stand near to a patch of grass in the area, far enough away so that the Pokemon in the grass are despawned</li>
  <li>Pause the game and re-identify your RNG state using Pokemon animations.</li><br />
  
  From this point it's recommended to only advance by opening and closing the menu and using animation/bike advancements as they are easier to keep track of.<br /><br />
  
  <li>Quickly close and reopen the pause menu to avoid any random advancements, re-identify your current seeds using the Retail Advances Tracker and take note of the number of advancements that have passed. Repeat this process a few times and then take the highest number of advances from your results.</li>
  <li>Advance closer to your target (within ~100 frames) and pause the game again, reidentify your current seeds.</li><br />

  From this point it's recommended to only advance using animations, animations provide a consistent +1 advancement per button press, which means we can use it to keep track advancements with 100% accuracy.<br /><br />
  
  <li>Use animation advances to advance close towards your target frame, factor in the number of advances that pass from closing the menu AND the area delay if known.</li>
  <li>Close the pause menu and run towards spawn point of the Pokémon, player movement advancements will not occur until the control stick is in a resting state. This gives the best chance at spawning the encounter on the correct frame.</li>
</ul>

A standard calculator can be helpful to keep track of inputs when advancing using animations, add +1 for each input you do on the Pokemon summary screen until you reach the target frame.<br /><br />

You can be creative with the methods you use to advance the RNG state.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure  5 -</span> Target Frame Hit!<br />
<img src="./images/symbol/figure-5-symbol-hit.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

By using animations and a standard calculator to keep track of inputs, we were able to hit out target frame!<br /><br />

Earlier we used seed re-identification and calculated that closing the pause menu advances roughly 3 frames. We also calculated that Slippery Slope has a delay of 2 for this encounter. So we are now a total of 5 frames away from the target with the pause menu open, closing the menu and running towards the grass should spawn the shiny Phantump we are targeting.<br /><br />

If you believe you hit your target frame, close the pause menu and quickly run towards the grass to spawn the Pokémon, capture it and confirm it matches the result displayed on the main window of the generator.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 6/7 -</span> Result Found!<br />
<img src="./images/symbol/figure-6-static-in-battle.jpg" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />
<img src="./images/symbol/figure-7-static-summary-screen.jpg" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">The Phantump matches the output of the generator, mission accomplished!</span> Espeon in party slot 1 with the ability Syncronize was used to determine the nature, using a Pokémon with this ability will make the nature of any overworld Pokémon match the nature of yours.<br /><br />

Different areas & environments can have a drastic influence on delay, if you are missing targets when you believe you should be finding results, you should consider reading the Troubleshooting Encounters section down below.<br /><br />

<hr />

<div class="bg-secondary title">
  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Troubleshooting Encounters</h1>
</div>

<hr />

This section covers how to troubleshoot encounters and delays. If you keep missing targets, spawning in the wrong Pokémon, or can't find your result on the RNG tool, this is the place to be.<br /><br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Missing Targets:</span></h3>
<u>The commonly occuring reasons for missing a target Pokémon are:</u>
<ul>
  <li>Encounter spawned too early/late due to mistiming.</li>
  <li>There is a delay left unaccounted for.</li>
  <li>Information in the main window was not completely accurate.</li>
</ul>

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Encounter spawned too early or too late...</span></h5>

This is a common issue players will face when tackling symbol encounters and is likely due to mistiming when spawning the Pokémon. Retry and search for a new target frame and make sure your player positioning is correct.<br /><br />

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Troubleshooting delay...</span></h5>

For the purposes of this guide, the term "delay" is used to describe the frame difference between the Pokémon we encountered and the frame the encounter was initiated on.<br /><br />

Most symbol encounters do need to account for some delay, this applies most to encounters in extreme weather conditions or in an otherwise unstable environment, like having other spawned Pokémon present.<br /><br />

Delay Calc - <code>frame Pokemon was generated - frame encounter was initiated = delay</code><br /><br />

We can use an IV calculator to confirm the exact frame the encounter was generated on and calculate the delay from there. Here's how it's done!
<ul>
  <li>Aim for a target, such as any shiny Pokémon.</li>
  <li>Run towards the Pokémon and spawn it in the overworld then initiate the encounter. Take note of the frame the Pokémon was spawned on.</li>
  <li>Encounter the Pokémon and capture it, then calculate the exact IVs using an IV calculator such as the <a href="https://www.serebii.net/games/iv-calcswsh.shtml">this one by Serebii</a>.</li>
  <li>If you didn't find the Pokémon that you expected, search for the specific IVs of the result you found and find the frame you hit.</li>
  <li>Subtract your target advancement from the frame you actually hit.</li>
  <li>This will be your delay for that particular encounter.</li>
</ul>

<u>When RNG abusing in unstable conditions you should record delays for multiple attempts before aiming for a target and check for any consistent delay counts. It is also advised to aim for large clusters where possible to increase your chances of actually hitting the target.</u><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 8 -</span> Delay troubleshooting example<br />
<img src="./images/symbol/figure-8-troubleshooting-encounters.jpg" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

We hit a shiny, but it wasn't Phantump! So what happened here? We actually hit a different frame within a shiny cluster which contained the encounter slot values for Snom, we can take a look by finding the exact Snom encounter in the <code>Encounter Lookup</code> tab, and clicking search again in the main window. <br /><br />

Make sure the <code>KO Count:</code> field is updated to match the species you are searching for! Here's a quick example:<br />
- We are seeking a Phantump and have 500 KOs according to the Pokédex.<br />
- We hit a Snom and have 90 KOs according to the Pokédex.<br />
- In order to find the Snom we are troubleshooting on the generator, we would need to enter <code>90</code> into the <count>KO Count:</code> field to match the Snom we caught.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 9 -</span> Calculating the IVs<br />
<img src="./images/symbol/figure-9-calculating-IVs.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

Using Psypokes IV calculator we can find the rough IVs of the Snom we hit and use this information to locate the exact frame we landed on according to the generator.<br /><br />

<u>If the Pokémon you find is non shiny you will need to be more specific with your filters, include the exact IVs displayed by the IV calculator to easily find the frame that you hit.</u><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 10 -</span> Finding the frame<br />
<img src="./images/symbol/figure-10-locating-frame.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

Here we can see Snom was indeed a shiny Pokémon within the cluster, (encounterslot value of 0-21 according to <code>Encounter Lookup</code>). Our goal was frame 25 and we hit frame 24, the tool shows these values are a match 1 frames earlier than our desired target frame, we will adjust accordingly by walking into the grass 1 frame later next time.<br /><br />

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Cannot find result...</span></h5>
If you cannot find the Pokémon you are in battle with anywhere on the tool this is likely due to one of two reasons:
<ul>
  <li>Player was positioned too close to the spawn and the Pokémon had already been generated long before walking into it.</li>
  <li>The information entered into the main window of the tool was not completely accurate.</li>
</ul>

Try to reposition your character and see if your issue persists, if you are still having problems double check the information on the main tab is entered correctly by searching it on the <code>Encounter Lookup</code> and clicking the correct row. <u>You must pay attention to the row you are clicking and making sure it matches your in-game environment.</u><br /><br />

That's all there is to it!<br /><br />
