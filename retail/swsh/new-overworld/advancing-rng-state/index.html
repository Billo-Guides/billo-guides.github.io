<p>RNG state advancements can occur naturally based on the overworld environment, or can be forced by performing specific actions. The most useful actions are listed in the table below.</p>

    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>When viewing the Pok&eacute;mon party list, pressing down on the <code class="fw-bold">Left Stick</code> causes the RNG state to advance by +1 with each press. Similarly, selecting a Pok&eacute;mon and viewing the summary screen, then pressing down on the <code class="fw-bold">Left Stick</code> advances the RNG state by +1 per animation (slower). Using the party list is the recommended method for performing this action.</p>

        <p>Due to the effectiveness of this method, menu close prediction will be referenced often throughout this guide. How to calibrate NPC counts will be explained later.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>Using the date skipping exploit to advance the RNG state rapidly. The number of advancements consumed per day skipped varies based on the number of Pok&eacute;mon currently stored in boxes (excluding eggs). With optimal box management, it is possible to consume upwards of 16,000 advances per day skipped.</p>

        <p><code span class="fw-bold">target frame / number of advances per day skipped = number of days to skip</code></p>

        <p>There are two versions of this exploit that can be used based on your setup, one requires partipating in a PvP battle, and the other requires interacting with a raid.</p>

        <h6 span class="fw-bold">PvP Exploit (Recommended):</h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the game, enter any Wild Area and visually observe raid locations.</li>
            <li>Open the Y-Comm, connect to the internet, then select the Link Battle option.</li>
            <li>Search for a battle with no code to find an online battle as quickly as possible.</li>
            <li>Once you have entered the battle, concede by clicking the run button.</li>
            <li>Change the console date forward in the System Settings, then enter the overworld.</li>
            <li>If done correctly, you should see the currently active raids have changed location.</li>
            <li>Navigate to an indoor location when skipping >1000 days to avoid crashing the game.</li>
            <li>Repeat this process from step 4, the exploit will remain active until the game is restarted.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><small>Technically, you can activate the exploit without connecting online. This requires communicating in a local battle, which means you will need to have 2 switches and 2 copies of Sword/Shield to do so.</small></p>

        <h6 span class="fw-bold">Raid Exploit (Slower):</h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the game, enter any Wild Area and find an inactive raid den.</li>
            <li>Throw a Wishing Piece into the raid den, then interact with it.</li>
            <li>Click invite others, then press the home button and navigate to System Settings.</li>
            <li>Change the console date forward in the System Settings, then open the game again.</li>
            <li>Back out of the raid and re-enter the overworld, and observe your raid den.</li>
            <li>If done correctly, you should see that you are able to claim Watts from the den.</li>
            <li>Repeat this process from Step 3 onwards as much as you like.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><small>This exploit is much slower than the PVP exploit. Players should only use this method if they do not have NSO or access to a second console/game to communicate locally.</small></p>

    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>Figure 9 illustrates the combination of three advancement techniques: wet weather, NPC activation, and bike bell usage. These methods collectively advance the RNG state rapidly without relying on date skipping.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Wet Weather -</span> Causes the RNG state to advance rapidly on its own simply change the weather to rain/thunderstorm and stand in the overworld.</li>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">NPC Activation -</span> Standing close enough to an NPC to "activate" them further increases the RNG advancement rate with minimal manual effort.</li>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Bike Bell/Whistling -</span> Ringing the bike bell (or player whistling) introduces additional advancements. While effective, this requires some manual input.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If done correctly, you should see that the NPC is facing the player, meaning they are now "active", and each time the player rings the bike bell or whistles, the NPC will blink (see the above image for a demonstration of this).</p>

        <h6 span class="fw-bold">Examples:</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>Standing next to <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/overworld/advancing-rng-state/ioa-diglett-npc.png">this NPC and his Diglett</a> in the IOA, while standing in Thunderstorm weather and ringing the bike bell, advances roughly 17,000 frames per minute.</li>
