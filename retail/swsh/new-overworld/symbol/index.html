    Worked examples for manipulating Symbol encounters in any weather condition.
</small>
<hr />

<p>The species produced in a Symbol spawner is determined by a random value known as an "encounter-slot", this value ranges from 0-99 to decide which Pokemon in the encounter table will spawn. The Pokemon that can be found in the encounter table will remain the same until the weather in the area changes, which can occur at midnight (00:00). Be mindful of the current system time to avoid spawning unexpected Pokemon due to incorrect weather conditions.</p>

        <h6 span class="fw-bold">Required Setup:</h6>
        <ol>
            <li>In the main window, enter your TID/SID, select your game version, and check the Shiny/Mark Charm checkboxes if these items are present in your save file.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Select <code class="fw-bold">Encounter Lookup</code> from the toolbar at the top of the owoow main window to open the sub-window, then type the name of your desired species.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Search for a SYMBOL encounter, then enter the Location/Weather/Species information into the <code class="fw-bold">Encounter Settings</code> section of the main window.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Enter the KO count for the Pokemon you are hunting inside the <code class="fw-bold">KOs</code> field, this is important for accurately predicting extra rolls caused by Brilliant Aura boosts.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Adjust your search range (the <code class="fw-bold">+</code> field in <code class="fw-bold">Encounter Settings</code>), then configure your search filters such as filtering for Shiny, Mark, IVs, Brilliant Aura, or Height.</li>
        </ol>

        <h6 span class="fw-bold">KO Mechanic &amp; Brilliant Aura:</h6>
        <p>Pokemon with Brilliant Aura can have higher shiny rates and two guaranteed perfect IVs, making them ideal for high-IV shiny manipulating. These boosts depend on how many of that species you've knocked out, which can be checked by <a href="/retail/swsh/new-overworld/images/symbol/ko-count.png" target="_blank">viewing the Pokedex entry</a>.</p>

        <p>To maximize Brilliant Aura boosts, 500 KOs on the species you are hunting is required. A practical alternative is 100 KOs with a Shiny Charm, improving Shiny rates from 1/1024 to 1/683.08, this provides a significant benefit for less effort. For more details on Brilliant Aura rates and Shiny rates, see <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Brilliant_Pok%C3%A9mon#Appearance_rate" target="_blank">Bulbapedia</a>.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <ol>
            <li>Fly to the area that contains your desired Pokemon, set the required weather condition in-game, then run around until you find the spawner that corrisponds to your desired Pokemon.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Run far enough away to completely despawn the Pokemon, then save the game. You can tell if you are positioned correctly by looking for a <a href="/retail/swsh/new-overworld/images/static/dust-cloud.png" target="_blank">dust cloud</a> or <a href="/retail/swsh/new-overworld/images/static/water-splash.png" target="_blank">puddle</a> at the foot of the Pokemon when spawning it in the overworld.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>If you cannot find a good position, you can knock out any additional static spawners that are blocking your path, those will remain despawned until the date is advanced and the area is reloaded.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Once you are positioned correctly, add your desired lead Pokemon to your party and then save the game once more. If you are unsure which lead Pokemon to use, click the button directly below.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The above location in Giant's Bed is ideal: no additional spawned Pokemon, no active NPCs, and Giant's Bed is notably "quiet" during calm weather conditions. A "quiet" area refers to an environment where the RNG naturally advances at a slow pace.</p>

    Step-by-step instructions for hitting a target frame can be found here.

<hr />

<p>The instructions for hitting a target frame depend on the selected weather condition. Rain and Thunderstorm are considered "advanced" and may be challenging for beginners. If this is your first time attempting this type of RNG manipulation it is recommended to start with a different weather condition to familiarize yourself with the general process.</p>
