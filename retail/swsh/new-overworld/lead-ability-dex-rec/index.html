    Understanding Pokemon ability influences and Pokedex recommendations to boost spawn rates.
</small>
<hr />


<p>This section explains advanced techniques involving the use of lead abilities and the using Pokedex recommendation feature. These methods are used to influence the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The details of a spawned Pokemon (e.g., nature and gender).</li>
    <li>The probability of spawning a particular Pokemon in the encounter table.</li>
    <li>Increasing the likelihood of triggering a hidden encounter.</li>
</ul>

<p>This table provides information about each of the lead abilities and their use cases:</p>

</div>
<small class="text-muted mb-3 mt-0">
    It is recommended to complete your Pokedex before using this method.
</small>
<hr />

<p>Upon opening the Pokedex, four Pokemon icons will be present on the left side of the screen, these four Pokemon are granted an increased spawn rate until the date is changed. This feature is commonly referred to as Pokedex recommendations or Dexrec. If the date has changed since the last time the Pokedex was opened, or if the Pokedex has not been opened at all, it is considered inactive. </p>

    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>In the above example, NidoranF, Sinistea, Heatmor and Magby are the currently boosted Pokemon, although the Dexrec was triggered in Giant's Bed, these Pokemon will have their spawn rate boosted globally, regardless of the current area, as long as the boosted Pokemon is present within an encounter table.</p>

        <p>Only the first form ID of a particular Pokemon will be boosted. For example, if our currently boosted Pokemon is Sinistea, this boost will only apply to the Phony form (the first form ID for Sinistea). This means that Sinistea-Antique cannot have an encounter rate boost from Dexrec at all.</p>

        <p>If your Pokemon can only be found within a specific weather, it is recommended to stand inside any of the Wild Areas and set your weather condition to match the Pokemon you wish to boost. Drampa is our desired Dexrec, and this Pokemon can found in Thunderstorm, so before starting, we have relocated to the Wild Area and are standing in Thunderstorm weather, exact location does not matter.</p>

        <span class="fw-bold text-light">Dexrec Rolling:</span>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <h6 span class="fw-bold">Step-By-Step:</h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Stand in any of the Wild Areas, then use the Encounter Lookup feature of owoow to search for your desired Pokemon.</li>
            <li>Take note of the weather condition that your Pokemon can be spawned in, then change the current weather to match.</li>
            <li>View the Pokedex to activate your daily dex recommendations, if this is not what you want, exit back into the overworld.</li>
            <li>Use any method of date skipping to reset daily events, then view the map again, repeat until you have achieved your desired Dexrec.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Ensure that you save after you have finished rolling for Dexrecs, as restarting the game will cause you to see the same Pokemon every single time due to the way the game stores the Dexrec seed.</p>

        <h6 span class="fw-bold">About Date Skipping:</h6>
        <p>The list of currently boosted Pokemon changes on every new day, this means that a dexrec cannot be stored past the day it was generated on. Due to having no real control over which Pokemon is boosted, this cannot be combined with the date skipping advancement method.</p>

        <p>If you are not using date skipping, roll your desired Dexrec and save the game, take note of the date the game has been saved on to avoid unintentionally rolling the current recommendations due to natural time progression.</p>

    <span class="fw-bold">Important -</span> For incomplete Pokedexes, the recommendations you will see will prioritize Pokemon that you have not yet captured. Completing your Pokedex will cause the game to boost random Pokemon, it is suggested to complete your Pokedex before rolling for Dexrec.
