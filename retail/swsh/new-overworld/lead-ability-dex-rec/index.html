    Understanding Pokemon ability influences and Pokedex recommendations to boost spawn rates.
</small>
<hr />


<p>This section explains advanced techniques involving the use of lead abilities and the using Pokedex recommendation feature. These methods are used to influence the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The details of a spawned Pokemon (e.g., nature and gender).</li>
    <li>The probability of spawning a particular Pokemon in the encounter table.</li>
    <li>Increasing the likelihood of triggering a hidden encounter.</li>
</ul>

<p>This table provides information about each of the lead abilities and their use cases:</p>

</div>
<small class="text-muted mb-3 mt-0">
    It is recommended to complete your Pokedex before using this method.
</small>
<hr />

<p>Upon opening the Pokedex, four Pokemon icons will be present on the left side of the screen, these four Pokemon are granted an increased spawn rate until the date is changed. This feature is commonly referred to as Pokedex recommendations or Dexrec. If the date has changed since the last time the Pokedex was opened, or if the Pokedex has not been opened at all, it is considered inactive. </p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 1 -</span> Dexrec Example<p></p>
<img src="/cfw/swsh/new-overworld/images/lead-ability-dex-rec/dex-rec-example.jpg" alt="dex-rec-1" class="img-fluid clickable-image" data-image="/cfw/swsh/new-overworld/images/lead-ability-dex-rec/dex-rec-example.jpg"><p></p>

<p>In the above example, NidoranF, Sinistea, Heatmor and Magby are the currently boosted Pokemon, <span class="fw-bold">ANY encounter table that contains these Pokemon will have this boost applied!</span> This means that a particular Dexrec is global and not restricted to a specific area.</p>

<p>Only the first form ID of a particular Pokemon will be boosted, for example, if our current Pokedex reccomendation is Sinistea, only the phony form will be boosted as this is considered to be Sinisteas first form, it is not possible to boost the antique form.</p>

<p>If you have not completed your Pokedex, the recommendations you will see will prioritize Pokemon that you have not yet captured. Completing your Pokedex will cause the game to boost random Pokemon, which is the suggested method to use when targeting something specific.</p>

<p><small>Anubis has provided a <a href="https://x.com/Sibuna_Switch/status/1409064932113633282">research thread</a> about dex recommendation for those wanting to learn more.</small></p>

<div class="alert alert-danger" style="border: 1px solid #b60606; border-radius: 8px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8d7da; color: #721c24;">
    <p><span class="fw-bold">Note -</span> Currently, we do not have any way to meaningfully control which Pokemon are boosted by Dexrec. For this reason, and because dex recommendation is cleared on each new day, it will be extremely unlikely to have a desirable Dexrec when using the date skipping advancement method.</p>
    <p>If you are not using date skipping, ensure that the correct dex recommendation has been set before you begin searching for/advancing to targets, otherwise, leave the dex recommendation inactive.</p>
       The dex recommendation seed is constant, meaning if you reset the game and advance the dexrec seed, you will see the same results every time. To avoid this, ensure you save after advancing the dexrec seed.
