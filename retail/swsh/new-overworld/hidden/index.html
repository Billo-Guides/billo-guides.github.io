    Worked examples for manipulating Hidden encounters in any weather condition.

<hr />

<p class="fw-bold" style="color: #c00000;">HIDDEN RNG SHOULD ONLY BE USED IF NO OTHER OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE FOR YOUR TARGET POKEMON, PICK A DIFFERENT ENCOUNTER TYPE WHERE POSSIBLE. HIDDEN RNG MAY TAKE MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS BEFORE HITTING A RESULT!</p>

<p>The species produced in a Hidden spawner is determined by a random value known as an "encounter slot", this value ranges from 0-99 to decide which Pokemon in the encounter table will spawn. The Pokemon that can be found in the encounter table will remain the same until the weather in the area changes, which can occur at midnight (00:00). Be mindful of the current system time to avoid spawning unexpected Pokemon due to incorrect weather conditions.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>In the main window, enter your TID/SID, select your game version, and check the Shiny/Mark Charm checkboxes if these items are present in your save file.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Select <code class="fw-bold">Encounter Lookup</code> from the toolbar at the top to open the sub-window, then type the name of your desired species and search for a HIDDEN encounter.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Close the <code class="fw-bold">Encounter Lookup</code> window, then enter the relevant Location, Weather &amp; Species information into the <code class="fw-bold">Encounter Settings</code> section of the main window.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Select your <code class="fw-bold">Lead Ability</code> &amp; <code class="fw-bold">Max Step</code>, it is recommended to use an ability that boosts the rate of triggering a hidden encounter and a Max Step count of 1.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Adjust your search range (the <code class="fw-bold">+</code> field in <code class="fw-bold">Encounter Settings</code>), then configure your search filters such as filtering for Shiny, Mark, IVs, or Height.</li>

    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <ol>
            <li>Remove any Pokemon that are currently stored in the {% include tooltips/daycare.html %} then fly to the location that contains your target Pokemon.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Locate the largest patch of grass in the area, then stand in a corner where possible. Ensure that you are facing towards the grass and not facing a wall.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>If you are being attacked by wild Pokemon, consider changing the weather and repositing yourself until you are standing spawns that are less aggressive.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Set the required weather condition in-game by changing the date, the spawned Pokemon will remain the same until they are despawned.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Dismount your bike if you are riding it. Hidden encounters are less likely to trigger if the player is riding a bike, even when using an optimal lead ability.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Add your desired lead Pokemon to your party and then save the game. Detailed information about lead abilities and their use cases can be found below.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>In most cases you will be forced to stand with extra spawned wild Pokemon, these Pokemon can cause extra unwanted advances when trying to hit a target frame. How to manage this issue will vary depending on your chosen weather condition and will be explained as you progress through this page.</p>

    Step-by-step instructions for hitting a target frame can be found here.

<hr />

<p>The instructions for hitting a target frame depend on the selected weather condition. Rain and Thunderstorm are considered "advanced" and may be challenging for beginners. If this is your first time attempting this type of RNG manipulation it is recommended to start with a different weather condition to familiarize yourself with the general process.</p>
