        <h6 span class="fw-bold">What Are Rain Ticks?</h6>
        <p>Rain Ticks refer to the RNG advances that occur when Rain or Thunderstorm are the active weather condition. The advances are used to randomly place raindrops on screen. Despite the sheer speed of RNG advances caused by wet weather, the number of advances remains predictable through proper calibration. We will perform this calibration using the <code class="fw-bold">Advanced Settings</code> section in the main window.</p>

        <p>For accuracy and stability, calibrate your Rain Ticks using encounters that spawn in a single step. Each step taken in grass causes a specific number of Rain Ticks, which appears to depend on your current location. The number of steps required to trigger a Hidden encounter is listed in the <code span class="fw-bold">Step</code> column of the search result table.</p>

        <h6 span class="fw-bold">Rain Tick Calibration</h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Position yourself optimally (see Figure 2 for a visual demonstration), then change the weather to anything that is NOT Rain/Thunderstorm. Check the current weather on your map, then save and reboot the game.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Immediately pause the game, identify your current seed, then calibrate your NPC count as normal. Close the <code class="fw-bold">MenuCloseTimeline</code> after calibrating and enter your NPC count into the main window.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Reboot the game and immediately pause, set your weather condition back to Rain/Thunderstorm (verify by opening the map). Then place a Pok&eacute;mon with No Guard, Illuminate, or Arena Trap into the lead slot of your party.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Save the game once more, you should now have correct positioning &amp; weather condition, a calibrated NPC count, and a lead Pok&eacute;mon with an ability that boosts the likelihood of spawning a hidden encounter.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>On owoow, set your weather condition back to Rain/Thunderstorm, then confirm your NPC count is correctly entered inside the main window. Once this is complete, click the <code span class="fw-bold">Consider Menu Close?</code>, <code span class="fw-bold">Holding Direction?</code> &amp; <code span class="fw-bold">Rain Ticks</code> checkboxes.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Reboot the game once more and immediately pause once you have entered the overworld. Open the Pok&eacute;mon party list, then identify your current seed, this will set your current advances to 0 which is important for calibration purposes.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Back out of the Pok&eacute;mon party list to enter the main pause menu, then hold a direction on your control stick (whichever direction takes a step inside the grass), then unpause the game to hopefully trigger a hidden encounter.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>The goal is to trigger an encounter in a single step then quickly initiate the encounter before it despawns. If your encounter does not spawn in a single step or did not spawn at all, reboot the game and try again.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Capture the Pok&eacute;mon and inspect the IVs using a calculator (e.g. <a href="https://www.serebii.net/games/iv-calcsv.shtml" target="_blank">Serebii</a> or <a href="https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/teambuilder" target="_blank">Showdown Teambuilder</a>), then enter them into the search filters of owoow and change the species inside the <code class="fw-bold">Encounter Settings</code> to match whatever you are in battle with.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>In <code span class="fw-bold">Advanced Settings</code>, click the <code span class="fw-bold">Calculate Rain Ticks</code> button, if done correctly you should see a result pop-up. Enter the calibrated value into the <code span class="fw-bold">Rain Ticks</code> field. You should expect to see a Rain Tick value of 20 or less in most cases.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The calibration checkboxes (<code class="fw-bold">Consider Menu Close?</code>, <code class="fw-bold">Holding Direction?</code>, and <code class="fw-bold">Rain Ticks</code>) account for frames consumed when leaving the Pok&eacute;mon party list and closing the main pause menu. The search results table will display the exact frame at which you should close the party list and main pause menu to then spawn your target Pok&eacute;mon in the overworld.</p>

    <span class="fw-bold">Troubleshooting -</span> If multiple potential results appear during calibration, you will need to repeat the process a few times or adjust your position until a consistent Rain Ticks value is found. If you see "No results found" something was done incorrectly. Retry while following the above steps more carefully.

        <span class="fw-bold text-light">Advancing to the Target</span>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>The recommended method for advancing the RNG state is to perform all advances in the pause menu, this can be done using <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/overworld/advancing-rng-state/wet-weather-menuing.gif">wet weather menuing</a> and <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/overworld/advancing-rng-state/animations.gif">animations</a>. These methods advance the RNG state slowly but offer the highest consistency between attempts. Advancing in the overworld will cause Rain Tick instability, do this at your own risk.</p>

        <p>In this example, a Shiny, Weather Mark Elekid appears in 2,856 advances. The calibrated NPC count is 4 and the current Rain Tick value is 20, and a direction on the control stick should be held while unpausing as this provides extra consistency between attempts.</p>

        <h6 class="fw-bold">Step-by-Step:</h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Confirm that the <code class="fw-bold">Consider Menu Close?</code> &amp; <code class="fw-bold">Holding Direction?</code> boxes have been checked, and that your NPC count and Rain Ticks have been entered properly.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Advance towards your target using wet weather menuing or animations until you are roughly 1000 advances away, then open the Pok&eacute;mon party list.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Disconnect and re-connect to owoow and search for your target again, this will reset your current advances to 0.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Use animations to advance to your new target frame. Each <code class="fw-bold">L3</code> button input on the party list advances the RNG state by +1 (e.g., 100 inputs = 100 advances).</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Back out from the party list into the main pause menu, then hold a direction on your control stick, hold a direction that will cause you to take a step in the grass.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Quickly initiate the encounter before it despawns (spawned Hidden encounters will despawn within a few seconds), then verify that the results match what is expected.</li>
        </ol>
