<p>This page contains information about finding and monitoring your current seed. Here you will learn the techniques used to find your initial seed and how to find your current RNG state at any given point.</p>

    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>On the far right of the main window, locate the button for the <code span class="fw-bold">Retail Seed Finder</code>, clicking it will open the sub-window displayed in Figure 1. This is where we will record a series of actions known as "motions" or "animations" to identify our current seed.</p>

        <h6 span class="fw-bold">What are motions/animations?</h6>
        <p>When on the summary screen of a Pokemon, clicking the <code span class="fw-bold">L3</code> button will cause the Pokemon to perform an animation. Most Pokemon have two seperate animations, which can be referred to as "Physical" or "Special". <a href="/retail/swsh/new-overworld/images/seed-calibration/seedfinder-overview-retail.gif" target="_blank">This gif</a> provides a short demonstration on how to identify animation differences.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>When Espeon lunges at the screen, we can identify that this is a physical animation.</li>
            <li>When Espeon stands in place, we can identify that this is a special animation.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It is important to pick a Pokemon that has a clear animation difference to make the process as simple as possible. Espeon, Gallade and Drilbur are the most commonly used Pokemon for this process.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>To determine your seed, you will need to accurately record 128 animations on the Pokemon summary screen, avoid using the party list for this process. Refer to Figure 2 for an example of proper practice.</p>

        <h6 span class="fw-bold">Step-by-step:</h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the pause menu, select a Pokemon and then click <code span class="fw-bold">Summary</code>, as stated, ensure that you are not using the party list.</li>
            <li>Make your Pokemon animate by pressing the <code span class="fw-bold">L3</code> button, take note of if the animation was physical or special.</li>
            <li>If the animation type was <u>physical</u>, type or click <code span class="fw-bold">0</code> into the <code span class="fw-bold">Animations</code> field of the SeedFinder.</li>
            <li>If the animation type was <u>special</u>, type or click <code span class="fw-bold">1</code> into the <code span class="fw-bold">Animations</code> field of the SeedFinder.</li>
            <li>Repeat this process 128 times to get your seed, then click <code span class="fw-bold">Update Main Form</code> to paste your seed into the main window.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If you do not want to use 0's and 1's for seed identification, owoow also accepts <code span class="fw-bold">,</code> or <code span class="fw-bold">s</code> for special inputs, and <code span class="fw-bold">.</code> or <code span class="fw-bold">p</code> for physical inputs, use whichever input is most comfortable for you.</p>

    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>After finding your seed and updating the main window, you will want to confirm that the seed is correct, this can be done in various different ways:</p>

        <details open>
            <summary span class="fw-bold">Re-identification (recommended):</summary>
        <ol>
            <li>Click <code span class="fw-bold">Update Main Form</code> after identifying your seed using the Seed Finder to update the main window.</li>
            <li>Select <code span class="fw-bold">Static</code> within the encounter settings, then toggle the search filters to seek any shiny Pokemon.</li>
            <li>If no result has been produced, increase the search range (the <code span class="fw-bold">+</code> field in the <code span class="fw-bold">Encounter Settings</code> column) and search again until you find a result.</li>
            <li>Navigate to the <code span class="fw-bold">Retail Tools</code> section, located on the far right of the main owoow window, then type a small number into the <code span class="fw-bold">+</code> field (~50 is fine).</li>
            <li>Click the <code span class="fw-bold">Generate</code> button, then begin recording animations inside the <code span class="fw-bold">Anim.:</code> field until a seed is produced (this should only require up to 20 animations).</li>
            <li>After a seed is produced, click the <code span class="fw-bold">Update Seeds</code> button to input your seeds into the correct field of the main window, then search for your shiny target again.</li>
            <li>You should see the same shiny Pokemon before and after re-identifying your seed. If this is not the case, this means your initial seed identification was incorrect, try again.</li>
        </ol>
        </details><p></p>

        <details>
        <summary span class="fw-bold">Using the search table:</summary>
        <ol>
            <li>Click <code span class="fw-bold">Update Main Form</code> after identifying your seed using the Seed Finder to update the main window.</li>
            <li>Select <code span class="fw-bold">Static</code> within the encounter settings, then change the search range (the <code span class="fw-bold">+</code> field) to a small number (~50 is fine).</li>
            <li>You will see that the next 50 search results have been produced, in this case, we will need to look inside the <code span class="fw-bold">Animations</code> column of the table.</li>
            <li>With the summary screen open, press the <code span class="fw-bold">L3</code> button and ensure that the animation aligns with the first result in the table.</li>
            <li>Repeat this process a few times, if you are on the correct seed, every animation should align properly.</li>
        </ol>
