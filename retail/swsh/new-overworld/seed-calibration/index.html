    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>On the far right of the main window, locate the button for the <code span class="fw-bold">Retail Seed Finder</code>, clicking it will open the sub-window displayed in Figure 1. This is where we will record a series of actions known as "motions" or "animations" to identify our current seed.</p>

        <h6 span class="fw-bold">What are motions/animations?</h6>
        <p>When on the summary screen of a Pokemon, clicking the <code span class="fw-bold">L3</code> button will cause the Pokemon to perform an animation. Most Pokemon have two seperate animations, which can be referred to as "Physical" or "Special". <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/retail/swsh/overworld/seed-calibration/animations.gif">this gif</a> provides a short demonstration on how to identify animation differences.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>When Espeon lunges at the screen, we can identify that this is a physical animation.</li>
            <li>When Espeon stands in place, we can identify that this is a special animation.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It is important to pick a Pokemon that has a clear animation difference to make the process as simple as possible. Espeon, Gallade and Drilbur are the most commonly used Pokemon for this process.</p>

        <span class="fw-bold text-light">Recording Animations:</span>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>To determine your seed, you will need to accurately record 128 animations on the Pokemon summary screen, avoid using the party list for this process. Refer to Figure 2 for an example of proper practice.</p>

        <h6 span class="fw-bold">Step-by-step:</h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the pause menu, select a Pokemon and then click <code span class="fw-bold">Summary</code>, as stated, ensure that you are not using the party list.</li>
            <li>Make your Pokemon animate by pressing the <code span class="fw-bold">L3</code> button, take note of if the animation was physical or special.</li>
            <li>If the animation type was <u>physical</u>, type or click <code span class="fw-bold">0</code> into the <code span class="fw-bold">Animations</code> field of the SeedFinder.</li>
            <li>If the animation type was <u>special</u>, type or click <code span class="fw-bold">1</code> into the <code span class="fw-bold">Animations</code> field of the SeedFinder.</li>
            <li>Repeat this process 128 times to get your seed, then click <code span class="fw-bold">Update Main Form</code> to paste your seed into the main window.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If you do not want to use 0's and 1's for seed identification, owoow also accepts <code span class="fw-bold">,</code> or <code span class="fw-bold">s</code> for special inputs, and <code span class="fw-bold">.</code> or <code span class="fw-bold">p</code> for physical inputs, use whichever input is most comfortable for you.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>After finding your seed and updating the main window, you will want to confirm that the seed is correct, this can be done in various different ways:</p>

        <details open>
            <summary span class="fw-bold">Re-identification (recommended):</summary>
            <ol>
                <li>After identifying your seed, click <code class="fw-bold">Update Main Form</code> in the Seed Finder to transfer the seed to the main window.</li>
                <li>Set the encounter type to <code class="fw-bold">Static</code> in the Encounter Settings, and adjust the search filters to look for shiny Pokemon.</li>
                <li>If no results appear, increase the search range by modifying the <code class="fw-bold">+</code> field in the <code class="fw-bold">Encounter Settings</code> column, then search again until a result is found.</li>
                <li>Go to the <code class="fw-bold">Retail Tools</code> section on the far-right of the owoow main window, and enter a small value (~50) into the <code class="fw-bold">+</code> field.</li>
                <li>Click the <code class="fw-bold">Generate</code> button and record animations in the <code class="fw-bold">Anim.:</code> field until a seed is generated (this usually requires up to 20 animations).</li>
                <li>Once a seed is produced, click <code class="fw-bold">Update Seeds</code> to populate the appropriate fields in the main window, and search for your shiny target again.</li>
                <li>If done correctly, the same shiny Pokemon should appear in the results both before and after re-identifying your seed. If not, your initial seed identification was likely incorrect. Repeat the process and try again.</li>
            </ol>
        </details><p></p>

        <details>
            <summary span class="fw-bold">Using the search table:</summary>
            <ol>
                <li>Click <code span class="fw-bold">Update Main Form</code> after identifying your seed using the Seed Finder to update the main window.</li>
                <li>Select <code span class="fw-bold">Static</code> within the encounter settings, then change the search range (the <code span class="fw-bold">+</code> field) to a small number (~50 is fine).</li>
                <li>You will see that the next 50 search results have been produced, in this case, we will need to look inside the <code span class="fw-bold">Animations</code> column of the table.</li>
                <li>With the summary screen open, press the <code span class="fw-bold">L3</code> button and ensure that the animation aligns with the first result in the table.</li>
                <li>Repeat this process a few times, if you are on the correct seed, every animation should align properly.</li>
            </ol>
