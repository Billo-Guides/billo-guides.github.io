    Understanding the concept of menu close prediction and how to calibrate your NPC count on RETAIL.
</small>
<hr />

<p>This page contains information about calibrating your NPC count, and using that knowledge to grant yourself the best possible chance of hitting a target frame/Pokemon. Menu close prediction is used extensively throughout this guide, so it is very important to have an understanding of how to use the technique to your advantage.</p>

    <span class="fw-bold">Important -</span> By this stage you should also understand how to find and monitor your current seed. If you have not yet read the provided information on this topic, go back and review the material.

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 1 -</span> Finding Your Current Seed<p></p>
<img src="/retail/swsh/new-overworld/images/menu-close-prediction/menu-close-demonstration.gif" alt="menu-close-prediction-1" class="img-fluid clickable-image" data-image="/retail/swsh/new-overworld/images/menu-close-prediction/menu-close-demonstration.gif"><p></p>

<p>In Figure 1, we have identified our current seed using the Retail Seed Finder, and the game is paused on the party summary screen (if you have already identified your current seed, simply re-identify your seed instead).</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 2 -</span> Menu Close Demonstration<p></p>
<img src="/retail/swsh/new-overworld/images/menu-close-prediction/menu-close-advances-viewer.gif" alt="menu-close-prediction-2" class="img-fluid clickable-image" data-image="/retail/swsh/new-overworld/images/menu-close-prediction/menu-close-advances-viewer.gif"><p></p>

<p>Close the pause menu and quickly re-open it, this will advance the seed a variable amount, based on the current number of NPCs in the area. After doing this, re-identify your current seed and take note of the total number of advances that were consumed. Do not click the <code span class="fw-bold">Update States</code> button yet.</p>

<p>Subtract the total number of advances from the amount of advances that were taken to re-identify your seed. In this example, x advances occured, and y animations were used to re-identify the seed, which means that z advances were consumed from closing the pause menu.</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 3 -</span> Menu Close Timeline<p></p>
<img src="/retail/swsh/new-overworld/images/menu-close-prediction/menu-close-timeline.gif" alt="menu-close-prediction-3" class="img-fluid clickable-image" data-image="/retail/swsh/new-overworld/images/menu-close-prediction/menu-close-timeline.gif"><p></p>

<p>Clicking the <code class="fw-bold">Consider Menu Close?</code> checkbox on the main window gains access to the <code class="fw-bold">Calibrate NPCs</code> button, clicking this button opens a sub-window. Here is where we will determine the amount of NPCs currently active in our location.</p>

<p>Upon opening, we can see that the current seed has been entered automatically, if you have not yet filled in the Encounter Settings in the main window to match your desired target, you will need to manually set your current weather condition.</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 4 -</span> Finding NPC Count<p></p>
<img src="/retail/swsh/new-overworld/images/menu-close-prediction/finding-npc-count.gif" alt="menu-close-prediction-4" class="img-fluid clickable-image" data-image="/retail/swsh/new-overworld/images/menu-close-prediction/finding-npc-count.gif"><p></p>

<p>After setting the appropriate weather condition and clicking "Search", a table will appear. We now need to tweak the value inside the <code span class="fw-bold">NPCs</code> box, and observe the <code span class="fw-bold">Jump</code> column of the table.</p>

<p>Earlier, we calculated that z advances were consumed from closing the pause menu, so we will tweak the value in the <code class="fw-bold">NPCs</code> field until we see a +z Jump inside the first row of the table, this will give us an idea of the current NPC count. </p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 5 -</span> NPC Count Found<p></p>

<p>After repeating this process a few more times, we can confirm that the number of advances matches the expected value for an 4 NPCs. Keep in mind that NPC count is subject to change based on positioning and location, if you switch either of this two variables you will need to re-calibrate the NPC count.</p>

    <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Final Notes</h1>
</div>
<hr />

<ul>
    <li>In most cases, the RNG state will stop advancing for a few seconds after closing the pause menu, this window of silence makes for an extremely reliable and consistent method of hitting your target frame.</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>NPC calibration will not work in wet weather, alter the weather by changing your system date if the current active weather is Rain or Thunderstorm. Weather can be changed back to its original state after calibrating NPC count.</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Holding a direction on your control stick will result in variation, it is not recommended to use direction hold when calibrating your NPC count, this feature is intended to be used for hitting target frames only.</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>After entering your NPC count into the main window, then searching for a target, the search results will display the advance that you are expected to close the pause menu on in order to hit your target frame.</li>
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-success" style="border: 1px solid #28a745; border-radius: 5px; padding: 15px;">
    <span class="fw-bold">Great!</span> You should now have a basic understanding of how to calibrate NPC counts, and how to apply that knowledge to accurately hit target frames (you can leave this page open for future reference).
