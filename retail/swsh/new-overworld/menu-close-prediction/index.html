    Understanding the concept of menu close prediction and how to calibrate your NPC count on RETAIL.
</small>
<hr />

<p>This page contains information about calibrating your NPC count, and using that knowledge to grant yourself the best possible chance of hitting a target frame/Pokemon. Menu close prediction is used extensively throughout this guide, so it is very important to have an understanding of how to use the technique to your advantage.</p>

    <span class="fw-bold">Important -</span> By this stage you should also understand how to find and monitor your current seed. If you have not yet read the provided information on this topic, go back and review the material.

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 1 -</span> Finding Your Current Seed<p></p>
<img src="/retail/swsh/new-overworld/images/menu-close-prediction/identifying-seed.gif" alt="menu-close-prediction-1" class="img-fluid clickable-image" data-image="/retail/swsh/new-overworld/images/menu-close-prediction/identifying-seed.gif"><p></p>

<p>In Figure 1, we have identified our current seed using the Retail Seed Finder. The game is also paused on the party summary screen after doing so (if you have already identified your current seed, simply re-identify your seed instead).</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 2 -</span> Menu Close Timeline<p></p>
<img src="/retail/swsh/new-overworld/images/menu-close-prediction/menu-close-timeline.png" alt="menu-close-prediction-2" class="img-fluid clickable-image" data-image="/retail/swsh/new-overworld/images/menu-close-prediction/menu-close-timeline.png"><p></p>

<p>Clicking the <code class="fw-bold">Consider Menu Close?</code> checkbox on the main window gains access to the <code class="fw-bold">Calibrate NPCs</code> button, clicking this button opens a sub-window. Here is where we will determine the amount of NPCs currently active in our location.</p>

<p>Upon opening the window you should see that your seed has been entered into the relevant fields automatically. If you have not yet entered any information into the <code span class="fw-bold">Encounter Settings</code> on the main window, you will need to change the weather condition to match the weather in your current area.</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 3 -</span> Menu Close Demonstration<p></p>
<img src="/retail/swsh/new-overworld/images/menu-close-prediction/menu-close-demonstration.gif" alt="menu-close-prediction-3" class="img-fluid clickable-image" data-image="/retail/swsh/new-overworld/images/menu-close-prediction/menu-close-demonstration.gif"><p></p>

<p>Close and re-open the pause menu quickly, this will advance the current RNG state (the amount will vary depending on the NPC count). After doing this, re-identify your seed using the <code span class="fw-bold">Retail Tools</code> section of the main window. <span class="fw-bold">DO NOT UPDATE STATES YET.</span></p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 4 -</span> Seed re-identification<p></p>
<img src="/retail/swsh/new-overworld/images/menu-close-prediction/seed-reident.gif" alt="menu-close-prediction-4" class="img-fluid clickable-image" data-image="/retail/swsh/new-overworld/images/menu-close-prediction/seed-reident.gif"><p></p>

<p>The <code span class="fw-bold">Adv.:</code> field displays two values after re-identifying your seed. The first box contains the total number of advances, and the second box contains the number of animations used to re-identify. Subtract the animations from the total number of advances, this will give you the # of advances consumed from closing the pause menu.</p>

<details>
    <summary span class="fw-bold">Example</summary>
    <p>6 animations were used to re-identify the seed, and a total of 11 advances were consumed throughout the whole process, we can now confirm that 5 advances were consumed from closing the pause menu.</p>
</details><p></p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 5 -</span> Finding NPC Count<p></p>
<img src="/retail/swsh/new-overworld/images/menu-close-prediction/finding-npc-count.gif" alt="menu-close-prediction-5" class="img-fluid clickable-image" data-image="/retail/swsh/new-overworld/images/menu-close-prediction/finding-npc-count.gif"><p></p>

<p>After clicking the <code span class="fw-bold">Search</code> button, a table will appear. We now need to tweak the value inside the <code span class="fw-bold">NPCs</code> box, and observe the <code span class="fw-bold">Jump</code> column of the table. The goal is to make the value in the <code span class="fw-bold">Jump</code> column match the amount of advances that were consumed from closing the pause menu.</p>

<p>Earlier, we calculated that 5 advances were consumed from closing the pause menu, so we will tweak the value in the <code class="fw-bold">NPCs</code> field until we see a +5 Jump inside the first row of the table, this will give us an idea of the current NPC count. </p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 6 -</span> NPC Count Found<p></p>
<img src="/retail/swsh/new-overworld/images/menu-close-prediction/npc-count-found.png" alt="menu-close-prediction-6" class="img-fluid clickable-image" data-image="/retail/swsh/new-overworld/images/menu-close-prediction/npc-count-found.png"><p></p>

<p>Click <code span class="fw-bold">Update States</code> at this point, and repeat this process 2-3 times to ensure that the NPC count matches correctly. In this case, our NPC count is x. Keep in mind that NPC count is subject to change based on positioning and location, if you switch either of this two variables you will need to re-calibrate.</p>

<p>Closing the <code span class="fw-bold">MenuCloseTimeline</code> will enter your calibrated NPC value into the main window automatically, keep this in mind.</p>

<div class="alert alert-success" style="border: 1px solid #28a745; border-radius: 5px; padding: 15px;">
    <span class="fw-bold">Great!</span> You should now have a basic understanding of how to calibrate NPC counts, and how to apply that knowledge to accurately hit target frames (you can leave this page open for future reference).
