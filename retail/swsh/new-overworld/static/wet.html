        <h6 span class="fw-bold">What Are "Rain Ticks"?</h6>
        <p>Rain ticks are the advances that occur as a result of Rain or Thunderstorm being active. Despite the sheer speed of advances caused by wet weather, the amount of advances that occur is predictable via calibration. Calibration can be done by using the <code span class="fw-bold">Advanced Settings</code> column of the main window.</p>

        <h6 span class="fw-bold">Rain Tick Calibration</h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Save the game when stood as close to the spawn border of your target Pokemon as possible, do not reposition yourself after this point.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Pause the game and identify your seed using the <code span class="fw-bold">Retail Seed Finder</code>, then calibrate your NPC count in any weather that is NOT Rain or Thunderstorm.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Set your weather back to Rain/Thunderstorm on both owoow and in-game. Double check that the weather conditions are correct.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Ensure that the <code span class="fw-bold">Consider Menu Close?</code> and <code span class="fw-bold">Holding Direction?</code> checkboxes on the main window are active, and enter your calibrated NPC count into the <code span class="fw-bold">NPCs</code> field.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>In the <code span class="fw-bold">Advanced Settings</code> column, check the <code span class="fw-bold">Raining/Thunderstorming?</code> checkboxes. For now, keep the <code span class="fw-bold">Rain Ticks</code> value set to 0 for the sake of calibration.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Open the Pokemon party list, then re-identify your seed to reset your advances to 0. This step is important for an accurate calibration.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Back out from the party list to the main menu, then hold a direction on your control stick (hold whichever direction leads you to your target Pokemon).</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Unpause the game while holding the correct direction on your control stick, then spawn the Pokemon in the overworld and initiate the encounter.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Capture the Pokemon and inspect the IVs using a calculator (e.g. <a href="https://www.serebii.net/games/iv-calcsv.shtml" target="_blank">Serebii</a> or <a href="https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/teambuilder" target="_blank">Showdown Teambuilder</a>), then enter them into the search filters of owoow.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>In <code span class="fw-bold">Advanced Settings</code>, click the <code span class="fw-bold">Calculate Rain Ticks</code> button, if done correctly you should see a result pop-up. Enter the calibrated value into the <code span class="fw-bold">Rain Ticks</code> field.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Once you have calibrated your NPC count and rain ticks, restart the game and reconnect to the program. You can now begin searching for target frames.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If there are multiple potential results when attempting to calibrate, consider repeating this process a few times until you get a common rain tick value. If you see "No results found", this means that you have done something wrong, try again.</p>

        <span class="fw-bold text-light">Advancing To The Target:</span>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>In the above example, a Shiny, Weather Mark Duraludon can be found in a cluster of advances from 9034-9035. A cluster is a group of frames that produce the same end result. It is recommended to target clusters where possible as this will further increase the chances of being able to hit your target frame.</p>

        <h6 span class="fw-bold">Step-by-step:</h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Advance towards your target using wet weather or the PVP date skipping exploit, this will ensure that your character does not change position (maintaining your rain tick calibration value).</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Re-identify your seed multiple times along the way to avoid overshooting your target. Advance the RNG state until you are a few hundred frames away from your target, then pause the game and open the party list.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Re-identify your seeds once more then search for your target frame again, doing this will start your advances from 0. Keep your game paused on the party list from this point onward.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Advance to your target frame using animations. Remember, using animations on the Pokemon party list advances the RNG state +1 per button input, which helps us to keep track of our current RNG state (e.g. 100 advances = 100 L3 button inputs).</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Ensure that the <code span class="fw-bold">Holding Direction?</code> checkbox is active, then back out from the party list into the main pause menu, hold a direction on your control stick at this point (towards the direction of the Pokemon spawner).</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Quickly run towards the spawner of your desired Pokemon, if done correctly, your Pokemon should have been spawned on the target frame, encounter it and check if it matches what is expected.</li>
        </ol>
