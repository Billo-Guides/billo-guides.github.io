<p>This guide provides coverage on how to RNG manipulate valuable items in Let's Go Pikachu & Eevee's Cerulean Cave and Celadon City Game Corner. This most useful application of this type of RNG is for farming Master Balls (Cerulean Cave), PP Max & Bottle Caps (Game Corner). The LGPE Item RNG Tool used throughout this guide was created by <a href="https://github.com/Lincoln-LM/lgpe-item-rng-tool">Lincoln-LM</a>, this tool was created based on initial research from <a href="https://x.com/e52301147">e52301147</a>, <a href="https://x.com/Sibuna_Switch">Anubis</a> & <a href="https://x.com/lincolnlm_">Lincoln</a>.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #b60606;">From here you are using an unmodified Switch console running stock firmware.</span></p>

    <ol>
      <li><span class="fw-bold">Access to Cerulean Cave or the Celadon City Game Corner.</span></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Cerulean Cave for Master Balls, Game Corner for Bottle Caps and PP Maxes.</li>

      <li><span class="fw-bold">TM 05 (Rest) Taught to Partner Pikachu or Eevee.</span></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Used for seed identification, teach rest to Pikachu or Eevee then put it to sleep by entering a battle and using Rest. Switch the Pokemon out and complete the battle after sleep status has been inflicted.</li>
      </ul><p></p>

      <li><span class="fw-bold">Spare Repels to use in Cerulean Cave.</span></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Wild Pokemon spawning produces unwanted and unpredictable advancements, if you plan to RNG manipulate Master Balls, ensure that you have plenty of repels.</li>
      </ul><p></p>

      <li><span class="fw-bold">Navigate to the correct location and save, then reset the game.</span></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Seed identification is best done by starting from a freshly reset game on a brand new day, ensure the game is saved and reset after following all the other setup instructions.</li>
      </ul><p></p>
    </ol>

    <blockquote>Each time the clock passes to 00:00, you will need to repeat step 4. Not doing so will result in being unable to identify your current seed using the recommended method.</blockquote>

    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Seed Identification</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>The above image displays the LGPE Item RNG tool, to find your current seed, you will need to use the <code span class="fw-bold">Seed Finding</code> tab. Finding your seed can be done one of two ways:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><span class="fw-bold">Observing "sleep messages".</span></li>
      <ul>
        <li>With your partner Pokemon asleep, pause the game and select "Play with Pikachu" or "Play with Eevee" depending on the game you are playing, and observe sleep messages.</li>
      </ul><p></p>

      <li><span class="fw-bold">Observing the candy obtained from transferring Pokemon.</span></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Transfer 128 Venomoth one-by-one to Professor Oak and observe the candies given. Venomoth is currently the only Pokemon supported by the RNG Tool, due to being the most common Pokemon that works for seed identification.</li>
      </ul>
    </ol><hr />

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Seed Identification - Sleep Messages:</span></h6>
    <p>This method is recommended as the requirements are a lot less strict and time consuming, the only requirement is that you have saved and reset the game with your partner Pokemon asleep. The example image above uses this method</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Open the game and enter the overworld, if you are planning to manipulate items in Cerulean Cave, use a repel and save the game, then reset and enter the overworld again.</li>
      <li>Open the Seed Finding tab of the LGPE Item RNG Tool, then select <code span class="fw-bold">Partner Observations Initial State</code> from the dropdown menu.</li>
      <li>Pause the game then click "PLAY WITH PIKACHU / PLAY WITH EEVEE", then take note of the message produced.</li>
      <li>If the message states "sleeping peacefully", type <code span class="fw-bold">p</code> into the <code span class="fw-bold">Partner Observations (d/p)</code> field.</li>
      <li>If the message states "in a deep sleep", type <code span class="fw-bold">d</code> into the <code span class="fw-bold">Partner Observations (d/p)</code> field.</li>
      <li>Repeat this process 64 times until a seed has been produced. Keep the game paused after identifying your seed to avoid any unwanted advancements.</li>
    </ol>

    <blockquote>You should be quick when observing sleep partner messages, staying in this menu over 3-5 seconds will cause extra unwanted advancements, observe the message, quickly back out, then note the message with a <code span class="fw-bold">p</code> or a <code span class="fw-bold">d</code> in the RNG tool.</blockquote>
    <hr />

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Seed Identification - Candy Transfers:</span></h6>
    <p>This method is slower, but is a more reliable method as it is guaranteed to find the correct seed if monitored correctly. Ensure that you save with the required 128 Pokemon caught in case of inaccurate observations.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Open the game and enter the overworld, if you are planning to manipulate items in Cerulean Cave, use a repel and save the game, then reset and enter the overworld again.</li>
      <li>Open the Seed Finding tab of the LGPE Item RNG Tool, then select <code span class="fw-bold">Candy Observations Arbitrary State</code> from the dropdown menu.</li>
      <li>Open Pokemon Box, then find the group of Venomoth you wish to transfer.</li>
      <li>Transfer the Pokemon one-by-one, and observe the candies given by Professor Oak.</li>
      <li>If a Quick Candy was produced, type <code span class="fw-bold">q</code> into the <code span class="fw-bold">Candy Observations (q/s)</code> field.</li>
      <li>If a Smart Candy was produced, type <code span class="fw-bold">s</code> into the <code span class="fw-bold">Candy Observations (q/s)</code> field.</li>
      <li>Repeat this process 128 times until a seed has been produced. Keep the game paused after identifying your seed to avoid any unwanted advancements.</li>
    </ol>

    <blockquote>You can use <code span class="fw-bold">Candy Observations Arbitrary State</code> instead if you wish, this requires less transfers but can result in seed inaccuracies on rare occasions.</blockquote>

  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Use any of the advancement methods in the table above to advance the RNG state. Seeds can be re-identified at any point by doing the following:</p> 

    <ol>
      <li>Open the <code span class="fw-bold">Seed Finder</code> tab again and click the <code span class="fw-bold">reidentification</code> checkbox.</li>
      <li>Enter the last known RNG state into the <code span class="fw-bold">Reidentification State</code> fields.</li>
      <li>Observe "sleep messages" again, if you have already forgotten how to do this, the method can be found <a href="#seed-identification-methods-lgpe-item">here</a></li>
      <li>After a new RNG state is produced, enter it into the <code span class="fw-bold">Item Prediction</code> tab and search for your target again.</li>
    </ol>

    <blockquote>This process can be repeated as many times as needed, it is recommended to stop advancing the RNG state at random once you are within ~50 advances of the target.</blockquote>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 6 -</span> Close To Target<p></p>
<a href="./images/item/target-hit.png" target="_blank"><img src="./images/item/target-hit.png" class="img-fluid"></a><br /><br />

<p>After reidentifying the current seed, we are now x frames away from the target, and the player standing next to a hidden item spot that can contain our desired item. Now we need to advance the RNG state in a predictable manner, by either transferring viewing partner messages (advances the RNG state by 2), or transferring Venomoths (advances the RNG state by 1).</p>

<p>It is recommended to use partner message advancements if your target is within a multiple of 2 from your current seed. You can transfer a single Pokemon to advance the RNG state by 1 if you are unable to hit your target using partner message advancements alone.</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 7 -</span> Result Found!<p></p>
<a href="./images/item/result-found.png" target="_blank"><img src="./images/item/result-found.png" class="img-fluid"></a><br /><br />

<p>According to the search results, a Master Ball will be produced after interacting with the item spot on advance x. Our calculations indicate that y advancements have occured (y partner message advancements), so it is now time to interact with the hidden item spot to claim our item.</p>

<p>A Master Ball was produced as expected, that's all there is to RNG manipulating valuable items in LGPE on retail hardware!</p>
