</div><hr />

<p>This guide provides coverage on how to RNG manipulate valuable items in Let's Go Pikachu & Eevee's Cerulean Cave and Celadon City Game Corner. This most useful application of this type of RNG is for farming Master Balls (Cerulean Cave), PP Max & Bottle Caps (Game Corner). The LGPE Item RNG Tool used throughout this guide was created by <a href="https://github.com/Lincoln-LM/lgpe-item-rng-tool">Lincoln-LM</a>, this tool was created based on initial research from <a href="https://x.com/e52301147">e52301147</a>, <a href="https://x.com/Sibuna_Switch">Anubis</a> & <a href="https://x.com/lincolnlm_">Lincoln</a>.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #b60606;">From here you are using an unmodified Switch console running stock firmware.</span></p>

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">You Will Need:</span></h6>

    <ol>
      <li><span class="fw-bold">Access to Cerulean Cave or the Celadon City Game Corner.</span></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Cerulean Cave for Master Balls, Game Corner for Bottle Caps and PP Maxes.</li>
      </ul><p></p>

      <li><span class="fw-bold">TM 05 (Rest) Taught to Partner Pikachu or Eevee.</span></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Used for seed identification, teach rest to Pikachu or Eevee then put it to sleep by entering a battle and using Rest. Switch the Pokemon out and complete the battle after sleep status has been inflicted.</li>
      </ul><p></p>

      <li><span class="fw-bold">Spare Repels to use in Cerulean Cave.</span></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Wild Pokemon spawning produces unwanted and unpredictable advancements, if you plan to RNG manipulate Master Balls, ensure that you have plenty of repels.</li>
      </ul><p></p>

      <li><span class="fw-bold">Items respawned in the area you wish to manipulate.</span></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Items in Cerulean Cave have a chance to respawn every 256 steps, Game Corner items refresh on a new day. You can automatically refresh Game Corner items by changing the system date while searching for a local trade.</li>
      </ul><p></p>

      <li><span class="fw-bold">Navigate to the correct location and save, then reset the game.</span></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Seed identification is best done by starting from a freshly reset game on a brand new day, ensure the game is saved and reset after following all the other setup instructions. This step will need to be repeated every time a new day passes (00:00 on the system clock).</li>
      </ul><p></p>
    </ol>

    <blockquote>A list of table item rates and spots for item spawners can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRrQhgQKyozIKZsDuoOzdt5anD_oRU3FNDmVZxbukG1VdgiKHdafvJuJsaydy0feiZZa0_i4WTkWSTn/pubhtml#">here</a>, to check if an item has respawned, stand next to the item spawner and check to see if the <a href="">tail of your partner Pokemon is waggling</a>.</blockquote>

    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Seed Identification</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>The above image displays the LGPE Item RNG tool, to find your current seed, you will need to use the <code span class="fw-bold">Seed Finding</code> tab. Finding your seed can be done one of two ways:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><span class="fw-bold">Observing "sleep messages".</span></li>
      <ul>
        <li>With your partner Pokemon asleep, pause the game and select "Play with Pikachu" or "Play with Eevee" depending on the game you are playing, and observe sleep messages.</li>
      </ul><p></p>

      <li><span class="fw-bold">Observing the candy obtained from transferring Pokemon.</span></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Transfer 128 Venomoth one-by-one to Professor Oak and observe the candies given. Venomoth is currently the only Pokemon supported by the RNG Tool, due to being the most common Pokemon that works for seed identification.</li>
      </ul>
    </ol><hr />

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Seed Identification - Sleep Messages:</span></h6>
    <p>This method is recommended as the requirements are a lot less strict and time consuming, the only requirement is that you have saved and reset the game with your partner Pokemon asleep. The example image above uses this method</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Open the game and enter the overworld, if you are planning to manipulate items in Cerulean Cave, use a repel and save the game, then reset and enter the overworld again.</li>
      <li>Open the Seed Finding tab of the LGPE Item RNG Tool, then select <code span class="fw-bold">Partner Observations Initial State</code> from the dropdown menu.</li>
      <li>Pause the game then click "<code span class="fw-bold">PLAY WITH PIKACHU / PLAY WITH EEVEE</code>", then take note of the message produced.</li>
      <li>If the message states "sleeping peacefully", type <code span class="fw-bold">p</code> into the <code span class="fw-bold">Partner Observations (d/p)</code> field.</li>
      <li>If the message states "in a deep sleep", type <code span class="fw-bold">d</code> into the <code span class="fw-bold">Partner Observations (d/p)</code> field.</li>
      <li>Repeat this process 64 times until a seed has been produced. Keep the game paused after identifying your seed to avoid any unwanted advancements.</li>
    </ol>

    <blockquote>Be quick to exit the menu after observing the message, staying in this menu over 3-5 seconds will cause extra unwanted advancements, observe the message, quickly back out, then note the message with a <code span class="fw-bold">p</code> or a <code span class="fw-bold">d</code> in the tool.</blockquote>
    <hr />

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Seed Identification - Candy Transfers:</span></h6>
    <p>This method is slower, but is a more reliable. It is guaranteed to find the correct seed if monitored correctly. Before starting, save with the required 128 Venomoths caught in case of any inaccurate observations.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Open the game and enter the overworld, if you are planning to manipulate items in Cerulean Cave, use a repel and save the game, then reset and enter the overworld again.</li>
      <li>Open the Seed Finding tab of the LGPE Item RNG Tool, then select <code span class="fw-bold">Candy Observations Arbitrary State</code> from the dropdown menu.</li>
      <li>Open Pokemon Box, then find the group of Venomoth you wish to transfer.</li>
      <li>Transfer the Pokemon one-by-one, and observe the candies given by Professor Oak.</li>
      <li>If a Quick Candy was produced, type <code span class="fw-bold">q</code> into the <code span class="fw-bold">Candy Observations (q/s)</code> field.</li>
      <li>If a Smart Candy was produced, type <code span class="fw-bold">s</code> into the <code span class="fw-bold">Candy Observations (q/s)</code> field.</li>
      <li>Repeat this process 128 times until a seed has been produced. Keep the game paused after identifying your seed to avoid any unwanted advancements.</li>
    </ol>

    <blockquote>You can use <code span class="fw-bold">Candy Observations Arbitrary State</code> instead if you wish. This requires less Venomoth transfers, but can result in seed inaccuracies on rare occasions.</blockquote>

    <p>Use any of the advancement methods in the table above to advance the RNG state. Seeds can be re-identified at any point by doing the following:</p>

  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>After re-identifying the current RNG state, the RNG tool displays that we are now x frames away from the target, and we have already relocated to a hidden item spot that can potentially contain the desired item.</p>

    <p>We now need to advance the RNG state in a predcitable manner to reach the seed/advance that contains the desired item. As a reminder, this can be done in one of two ways:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Viewing partner sleep messages (a consistent +2 advance).</li>
      <li>Transferring Venomoths (a consistent +1 advance).</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Use sleep partner messages to get as close as you can to your target. If you are an even number of advances away from the target, you do not need to use Venomoth transfers. Venomoth transfers can be used to do the final advance if you are an odd number of advances away from the target.</p>

<a href="./images/item/result-found.png" target="_blank"><img src="./images/item/result-found.png" class="img-fluid"></a><br /><br />

<p>According to the search results, a Master Ball will be produced after interacting with the item spot on advance x. Our calculations indicate that y advancements have occured (from doing y partner message advancements), so it is now time to interact with the hidden item spot to claim our item.</p>

<p>A Master Ball was produced as expected, that's all there is to RNG manipulating valuable items in LGPE on retail hardware!</p>
