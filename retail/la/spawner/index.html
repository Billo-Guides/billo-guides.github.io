  <p>This page will provide in-depth information about how to RNG abuse Legendary Pokemon in Legends: Arceus that are tied to what is known as Spawners. We will be using RNG automation programs written by <a href="https://github.com/lusamine">Lusamine</a>, as mentioned on the main page.</p>
  
  <p><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #b60606;">From here it is assumed that you have already followed all of the setup & installation instructions found on the introductory page of this guide. You should also understand how to interact with a SysBot to dump the necessary .pa8 files needed to use the scripts.</span></p>

  <p>Before anything else, it is important to disable autosave, gather enough healing/throwable items, and have a strong Pokemon capable of easily defeating the Pokemon you wish to RNG abuse.</p>

    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Frame Advancements:</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Frame advancement methods will differ depending on if your Pokemon is an forced capture or despawns when defeated, this section will cover how to advance frames in both of these scenarios.</p>

    <h5 class="fw-bold">Despawns When Defeated:</h5>
    <p><span class="fw-bold">These include -</span> Tornadus, Thundurus, Landorus, Enamorus, Shaymin & Darkrai.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Knockout the legendary, then fly to a campsite.</li>
      <li>Sleep until night, then sleep again until evening.</li>
      <li>Fly to a cave and enter, then save and reboot the game.</li>
      <li>(Optional but optimal) Fly to a campsite then sleep until evening.</li>
      <li>Fly back to the legendary and wait 1 weather cycle for the legendary to respawn.</li>
      <li>Repeat from step 1 until the desired frame has been hit.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <blockquote><span class="fw-bold">Note -</span> Tornadus, Thundurus and Darkrai only respawn in certain conditions, Tornadus in a Blizzard, Thundurus in a Thunderstorm, and Darkrai at night.</blockquote>
    <hr />

    <h5 class="fw-bold">Forced Capture:</h5>
    <p><span class="fw-bold">These include -</span> Uxie, Mesprit, Azelf, Heatran & Cresselia.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Knockout the legendary.</li>
      <li>Click through the menus until you regain control of your character.</li>
      <li>Repeat from step 1 until the desired frame has been hit.</li>
    </ol>

    <blockquote><span class="fw-bold">Note - </span>All of these Pokemon are located in caves, with the exception of Cresselia, come well prepared to avoid needing to leave the area.</blockquote>
    <hr />

    <h5 class="fw-bold">Unique Cases:</h5>
    <p><span class="fw-bold">These include -</span> Manaphy & Phione.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Knockout the legendary, then fly to a campsite.</li>
      <li>Sleep until night, then sleep again until evening.</li>
      <li>Warp to Fire Pit Island and enter the cave, then save and reboot the game.</li>
      <li>Fly back to the cave that contains Manaphy and wait 1 weather cycle for it to respawn.</li>
      <li>Enter the cave, check to see if your Pokemon has respawned.</li>
      <li>Repeat from step 1 until the desired frame has been hit.</li>
    </ol>

    <blockquote><span class="fw-bold">Note -</span> Manaphy & Phione are unique cases, they are contained inside a cave but do not immediately respawn. The method used to respawn these Pokemon is more akin to the method used for Overworld.</blockquote>

   <p>This section of the guide aims to provide a step-by-step guide of the start to finish process for Spawner RNG abuse. You can follow along if you do not already have complete understanding of how to use the RNG scripts or advance towards a result.</p>

   <span class="fw-bold">Figure 1 -</span> How To Use - Seed Solver Script<p></p>
   <a href="/retail/la/spawner/images/how-to-use-seed-solver.gif" target="_blank"><img src="/retail/la/spawner/images/how-to-use-seed-solver.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"></a><br /><br />

   <p>First, dump the two necessary .pa8 files of the Pokemon you are hunting, then place them into the <code class="fw-bold">pa8</code> folder that was created earlier, check that the path is correct, then run the script after doing so.</p>
    
   <p>After a short wait you should now see that a group seed has been produced, copy it, this seed is the seed that the Calculation Script will need to calculate the upcoming advancements of the Pokemon on the spawner that you are searching.</p>

   <span class="fw-bold">Figure 2 -</span> How To Use - RNG Calculation Script<p></p>
   <a href="/retail/la/spawner/images/how-to-use-calculator.gif" target="_blank"><img src="/retail/la/spawner/images/how-to-use-calculator.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"></a><br /><br />

   <p>Copy the group seed that was produced by the Seed Solver Script, then paste it into the Spawner RNG Calculation Script on the line that starts with <code class="fw-bold">ulong group_seed = 0x</code> (located towards the top of the script).</p> 
    
   <p>In this example the seed that was produced is <code class="fw-bold">264cc9c14e639858</code>, If you have pasted the seed into the script correctly it should look similar to the following:</p> 

   <div class="alert border-dark" style="background-color: #d1d1d1;">              
    <code class="fw-bold" style="color: #0a7a00;">// Initial State</code><br>
    <code class="fw-bold" style="color: #2e62bf;">ulong</code> <code class="fw-bold" style="color: #000000;">group_seed =</code> <code class="fw-bold" style="color: #af82de;">0x1234567887654321;</code> <code class="fw-bold" style="color: #0a7a00;">// group seed</code><br>
    <code class="fw-bold" style="color: #2e62bf;">ulong</code> <code class="fw-bold" style="color: #000000;">init =</code> <code class="fw-bold" style="color: #2e62bf;">unchecked</code><code class="fw-bold" style="color: #000000;">(group_seed)</code><br>
    <code class="fw-bold" style="color: #000000;">Xoroshiro128Plus rng =</code> <code class="fw-bold" style="color: #2e62bf;">new</code><code class="fw-bold" style="color: #000000;">(init)</code> 
    </div><p></p>

   <span class="fw-bold">Figure 3 -</span> Setting Filters - Calculation Script<p></p>
   <a href="/retail/la/spawner/images/setting-filters-calculator-script.gif" target="_blank"><img src="/retail/la/spawner/images/setting-filters-calculator-script.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"></a><br /><br />

   <p>To search for flawless IV spreads, activate the filters found towards the bottom of the script. By default the IV filters will be disabled and will need to be activated manually, this can be done by removing the comments (<code class="fw-bold" style="color: #0a7a00;">*/</code>) that surround the IV filters at the top and the bottom.</p>

   <p><span class="fw-bold">For Heatran specifically</span>, you will also need to set the <code class="fw-bold">GenderCompare</code> value at the top of the script to 127, Heatran is the only case where this value should be changed from -1 as the rest of these legendaries have a fixed gender or are genderless.</p>

   <p>If your search result is not desirable or you do not find any results when searching with filters, you will need to return to Jubilife then back to the map that contains the legendary you are hunting in order to refresh the seed, then find your current seed again (see Figure 1).</p>
   
   <span class="fw-bold">Figure 4 -</span> Target Found!<p></p>
   <a href="/retail/la/spawner/images/target-found-spawner.png" target="_blank"><img src="/retail/la/spawner/images/target-found-spawner.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"></a><br /><br />

   <p>We will be searching for any Enamorus with an speed IV value of 0, In the above image, we can see that there is an Enamorus that matches this description in 5 advances! This means we will need to knock out and respawn Enamorus 5 times to hit the correct target frame.</p>

   <p>Advance the RNG state using the <a href="#advancing-the-rng-state">above mentioned method</a>. Enamorus is one of the Pokemon that will despawn when defeated, so we will will need to follow the "despawns when defeated" steps in order to effectively respawn it.</p>

   <span class="fw-bold">Figure 5 -</span> Result Found!<p></p>
   <a href="/retail/la/spawner/images/result-found-spawner.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/retail/la/spawner/images/result-found-spawner.jpg" style="width:675px;height:400px;"></a><br /><br />

   <p>After advancing 5 frames we have now reached our target frame and found the Enamorus that is believed to have an speed IV value of 0!</p>
    
   <p>Legends: Arceus has no way to check the exact IV values in-game, this means you will need to confirm the IVs of the Pokemon by either dumping it using a Sysbot or viewing it inside Pokemon HOME.</p>

   <span class="fw-bold">Figure 6 -</span> IV confirmation<p></p>
   <a href="/retail/la/spawner/images/how-to-use-seed-solver.gif" target="_blank"><img src="/retail/la/spawner/images/iv-confirmation-spawner.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"></a><br /><br />

   <p>After dumping the Enamorus using Sysbot.NET and viewing the file in PKHeX, we have confirmed that the IVs & nature match what was produced by the script.</p>

   <p><span class="fw-bold">That's all there is to RNG legendary Pokemon tied to spawners on retail hardware!</span></p>
