  </div><hr />

  <p>You can manipulate RNG for most Legendary and Mythical Pokemon using official hardware. This technique allows you to obtain your desired IVs and Nature combinations for these Pokemon.</p>

  <p>There are two primary methods for generating the internal values of these encounters: Spawner RNG and Main RNG. Only Spawner RNG can be manipulated on retail hardware.</p>

     <h5><span class="fw-bold">What is Spawner RNG?</span></h5>

     <p>Spawners contain specific Pokemon visible in the overworld. When the Pokemon is knocked out and respawned, the spawner seed advances by 1 frame. Achieving the desired result involves respawning the Pokemon a certain number of times in succession until you reach your target frame.</p>
 
     <h6><span class="fw-bold">Spawner RNG Encounters:</span></h6>
     <ul>
       <li>Lake Trio - Uxie, Mesprit & Azelf</li>
       <li>Weather Quartet - Tornadus, Thundurus, Landorus & Enamorus</li>

       <li>Manaphy/Phione</li>
       <li>Shaymin</li>
       <li>Darkrai</li>

     <blockquote>Any other Legendary or Mythical Pokemon not present in the above list is tied to Main RNG and is impossible to RNG abuse on a retail device at this point in time.</blockquote>

  <p>By running this script, we can confirm that everything is configured correctly if a result appears at the bottom of the window when using the example/placeholder seed.</p>

  <p>Here we can see the Seed Solver Script has been configured correctly as the following message was produced at the bottom of the main window:</p>

  <blockquote><code class="fw-bold">DirectoryNotFoundException<br>
    Could not find a part of the path 'C:\Users\USER\Desktop\pa8'.</code></blockquote>

  <p>This error message indicates that the script is working properly but cannot find any <code class="fw-bold">.pa8</code> files in the selected directory. To resolve the seed, you need two consecutive <code class="fw-bold">.pa8</code> files from the same spawner. Ensure these files are present in the directory for the script to function correctly.</p>

  <p>You can find information about how to dump the necessary <code class="fw-bold">.pa8</code> files and how to advance the Spawner seed below.</p>

      <span class="fw-bold text-light">Finding Current Seed:</span>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
      <p>To find your current seed you will need access to a SysBot. These bots are capable of dumping the <code class="fw-bold">.pa8</code> files required to use the seed solver script without needing to physically trade the Pokemon. Not saving gives the player the opportunity to reset the game if they are left with an undesirable seed.</p>

      <p>Many free SysBots are hosted in community focused discord servers, these can be found with a quick google search. Make sure that the bot you are attempting to use is compatible with Legends: Arceus.</p>

      <h5><span class="fw-bold" id="finding-current-seed-using-sysbot">Using SysBot to find your current seed:</span></h5>
      <ol>
        <li>Open the game settings and disable autosave if you have not already done so.</li>
        <li>Head into the map location of your desired Legendary, then manually save the game.</li>
        <li>Capture the legendary, then return to Jubilife without saving the game.</li>
        <li>Initiate a SysBot dump trade, then dump the Legendary Pokemon that you caught.</li>
        <li>Reset the game, this time, KO the Pokemon instead of catching it.</li>
        <li>Advance a single frame, then capture the next Legendary that spawns.</li>
        <li>Initiate another SysBot trade, dump the Pokemon again and reset the game.</li>
        <li>You should now have two sequencial pa8 files and be back in correct map location.</li>
        <li>Put both of the dumped .pa8 files inside the <code class="fw-bold">pa8s</code> folder that was created earlier.</li>
        <li>Run the Seed Solver script until a seed is produced.</li>
      </ol>
      
      </div>
    </div><br>

  <p>You can now paste your seed over the placeholder seed found in the Spawner RNG Calculation script pictured above, if your result seed is not desirable, repeat the above process from step 1. If you are uncertain how to advance the spawner seed (as per step 6), continue reading below.</p>

      <li>(Optional but optimal) Fly to a campsite then sleep until evening.</li>
      <li>Fly back to the legendary and wait 1 weather cycle for the legendary to respawn.</li>

    <h5 class="fw-bold">Forced Capture:</h5>
    <p><span class="fw-bold">These include -</span> Uxie, Mesprit, Azelf, Heatran & Cresselia.</p>

    <ol>

      <li>Warp to Fire Pit Island and enter the cave, then save and reboot the game.</li>
      <li>Fly back to the cave that contains Manaphy and wait 1 weather cycle for it to respawn.</li>
      <li>Enter the cave, check to see if your Pokemon has respawned.</li>

    <p>You should now have a general understanding of how to use each of the scripts, have access to a SysBot and understand how to use it to dump <code class="fw-bold">.pa8</code> files, and how to advance the spawner seed of your desired Pokemon.</p>
