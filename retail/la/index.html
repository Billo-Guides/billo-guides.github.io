<p>This guide provides detailed instructions on RNG abusing Legendary/Mythical Pokemon in Legends: Arceus, leveraging RNG scripts developed by <a href="https://github.com/Lusamine">Lusamine</a>. Most Legendary/Mythical Pokemon encounters can be manipulated using official stock hardware.</p>

<p>There are two primary methods used by the game to generate the internal details (IVs/Nature) of a legendary or mythical Pokemon. These seeding methods are commonly referred to as "Spawner RNG" and "Main RNG", currently, only those tied to Spawner RNG can be manipulated on retail hardware.</p>
  
<p><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #b60606;">From here it is assumed you are using a unmodified Switch console and running stock firmware. This guide is also targeted towards Windows OS users.</span></p>

    <span class="fw-bold text-light">What is a "Spawner"?:</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Spawners contain specific Pokemon and are visible in the overworld. When a Pokemon generated by spawner RNG is knocked out and respawned, the spawner seed advances by 1 frame.</p>
    
    <p>Reaching a desired target involves finding your spawner seed, calculating the upcoming advancements, then advancing the spawner seed until the target has been reached. All of these concepts will be explained later.</p>

    <li>Find the Spawner Calculation script, then copy and paste all of it into the main window, if done correctly it should look similar to Figure 1.</li>
    <li>Press F4 to open a sub window, here is where you will add the relevant dll files needed to run the script.</li>

<p>This section covers information about finding and advancing the spawner seed. Ensure that autosave is disabled in the game settings before continuing, not saving lets you reset the game if the seed turns out to be undesirable. From here onwards it is assumed that autosave has been disabled.</p>

    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Finding A Spawner Seed:</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>To find your spawner seed, you’ll need access to a SysBot. These bots can dump the <code class="fw-bold">.pa8</code> files needed for seed solving without requiring a physical trade, as trading will force a game save.</p>

    <p>Many free SysBots are available in community Discord servers—search online to find one compatible with Legends: Arceus.</p>
    
    <h6><span class="fw-bold" id="finding-current-seed-using-sysbot">Using SysBot:</span></h6>
    <ol>
      <li>Go to the map location of your desired Legendary and manually save.</li>
      <li>Capture the Pokemon, then return to Jubilife and head to the trade post.</li>
      <li>Initiate a dump trade with the SysBot, then show it the captured Pokemon.</li>
      <li>Reset the game, KO the Legendary this time, and advance the spawner seed once.</li>
      <li>Capture the next Legendary spawn, perform another SysBot dump, and reset again.</li>
      <li>Download the two <code class="fw-bold">.pa8</code> files provided by the bot (found in private messages).</li>
      <li>Now you should have two sequential <code class="fw-bold">.pa8</code> files and be back at the correct map location.</li>  
    </ol>

    <p>Place both .pa8 files in the previously created pa8s folder and run the Seed Solver script to generate a seed, this seed can then be pasted into the Spawner Calculation script to search for upcoming target frames.</p>
      
  </div>
</div><br>

<p>If you are unsure how to advance the spawner seed (as per Step 4), continue reading the section below.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Frame advancement methods will differ depending on if your Pokemon is an forced capture or despawns when defeated, this section will cover how to advance frames in both of these scenarios.</p>

    <h5 class="fw-bold">Despawns When Defeated:</h5>
    <p><span class="fw-bold">These include -</span> Tornadus, Thundurus, Landorus, Enamorus, Shaymin & Darkrai.</p>

      <li>Knockout the legendary, then fly to a campsite.</li>
      <li>Sleep until night, then sleep again until evening.</li>
      <li>Fly to a cave and enter, then save and reboot the game.</li>
      <li>(Optional but optimal) Fly to a campsite then sleep until evening.</li>
      <li>Fly back to the legendary and wait 1 weather cycle for the legendary to respawn.</li>
      <li>Repeat from step 1 until the desired frame has been hit.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <blockquote><span class="fw-bold">Note -</span> Tornadus, Thundurus and Darkrai only respawn in certain conditions, Tornadus in a Blizzard, Thundurus in a Thunderstorm, and Darkrai at night.</blockquote>
    <hr />

    <h5 class="fw-bold">Forced Capture:</h5>
    <p><span class="fw-bold">These include -</span> Uxie, Mesprit, Azelf, Heatran & Cresselia.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Knockout the legendary.</li>
      <li>Click through the menus until you regain control of your character.</li>
      <li>Repeat from step 1 until the desired frame has been hit.</li>
    </ol>

    <blockquote><span class="fw-bold">Note - </span>All of these Pokemon are located in caves, with the exception of Cresselia, come well prepared to avoid needing to leave the area.</blockquote>
    <hr />

    <h5 class="fw-bold">Unique Cases:</h5>
    <p><span class="fw-bold">These include -</span> Manaphy & Phione.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Knockout the legendary, then fly to a campsite.</li>
      <li>Sleep until night, then sleep again until evening.</li>
      <li>Warp to Fire Pit Island and enter the cave, then save and reboot the game.</li>
      <li>Fly back to the cave that contains Manaphy and wait 1 weather cycle for it to respawn.</li>
      <li>Enter the cave, check to see if your Pokemon has respawned.</li>
      <li>Repeat from step 1 until the desired frame has been hit.</li>
    </ol>

    <blockquote><span class="fw-bold">Note -</span> Manaphy & Phione are unique cases, they are contained inside a cave but do not immediately respawn. The method used to respawn these Pokemon is more akin to the method used for Overworld.</blockquote>

    </div>
  </div><br>

  <p>You should now have a general understanding of how to use each of the scripts, have access to a SysBot and understand how to use it to dump <code class="fw-bold">.pa8</code> files, and know how to advance the spawner seed of your desired Pokemon.</p>
