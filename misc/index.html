<p>This page contains everything a global staff member needs to moderate the Wi-Fi room, almost entirely using <code span class="fw-bold">/rfaqs</code>!</p>

<p>Rules for room etiquette, trading & giveaways can be found in the navigation bar at the top of this page.</p>

  <div class="card-header text-light" style="background-color: #08265e;" id="modchat"><span class="fw-bold">Modchat</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>By standard, modchat should be set to Autoconfirmed. Please do not set this higher than autoconfirmed, even when there are no staff members available to watch the chat.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Here are some common topics that go against the room rules:</p>

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Genning, hacking or glitch discussion:</span></h6>
    <p>These topics are strictly forbidden, and any discussion should be cleared from the room as soon as possible. This also includes old glitches that allow the obtainment of illegal Pokémon (such as the Mew glitch in gen 1 or "tweaking/void glitching" in gen 4).</p>
    
    <p>Also be on the lookout for trade offers that involve unreleased or clearly hacked Pokémon, for example if a user was offering a Shiny Hoopa. A list of shiny locked Pokémon can be found on <a href="https://www.serebii.net/games/shiny.shtml">Serebii</a>.</p>
    
    <p>If a user is seeking advice about if a Pokémon they own, please redirect them to a member of <code span class="fw-bold">/rfaq isthishacked</code> or redirect them to a member of <code span class="fw-bold">/roomstaff</code>.</p>

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">AltWFC/Pretendo (unofficial online servers):</span></h6>
    <p>These topics are usually brought up with someone attempting to trade on a game/console that no longer has an active online service, posts such as "Anyone wants to trade in gen 4 / 5?" are an example of this. Trading using these servers is not allowed and users can be referred to <code span class="fw-bold">/rfaq altwfc</code>.</p>

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Piracy, emulation and rom hacks:</span></h6>
    <p>Any mention or allusion to these topics should be instantly cleared from chat. Users can be directed to <code span class="fw-bold">/rfaq piracy</code>. Examples of emulators include VBA, MGBA, Bizhawk, Desmume, Citra, Yuzu, Ryujinx.</p>
