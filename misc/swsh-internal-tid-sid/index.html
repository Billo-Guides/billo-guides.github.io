<p>This tutorial provides a range of methods for how you can find your 5 digit TID/SID combination in Sword/Shield. Knowing these values is necessary if you wish to RNG abuse Shiny Pokémon from overworld encounters.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #b60606;">THIS GUIDE IS USABLE, BUT UNFINISHED. NO IMAGES ARE CURRENTLY PROVIDED.</span></p>

  <div class="card-body card-bg">
   <p>It is not possible to RNG abuse your TID or SID in Sword/Shield. This tutorial is only for finding your internal TID/SID on an existing save file. There are three possible methods you can use, these are:</p>

   <h6><span class="fw-bold">Using SysBot.NET</span></h6>
   <p>SysBot.NET is a bot service hosted by members of the community, typically found in Discord servers. If you do not have access to a SysBot, you can find a public server with a quick Google search.</p>

   <p>SysBots come with dump functionality, which dumps the data of the shown Pokémon into a <code span class="fw-bold">.pk8</code> file, this file is then shared into your Discord messages with the bot.</p>

   <p>The file can then be manually inspected using a program like PKHeX to view your TID/SID combination. This method is recommended as it takes the least effort, but does require a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.</p>
   <hr />

   <h6><span class="fw-bold">Help from a friend</span></h6>
   <p>If you have a friend with a CFW Switch console, they are capable of dumping the file for you, but they will need access to PKHeX to do so.</p>

   <p>You can also have a friend check your TID/SID combination if you do not have access to PKHeX. PKHeX only works on Windows devices. This method is only recommended if you do not have any access to a Sword/Shield SysBot.</p>
   <hr />

   <h6><span class="fw-bold">Finding a shiny Pokémon without RNG abuse</span></h6>
   <p>If you do not have access to the above options at all, you will need to manually search for a shiny Pokémon in the wild. It is possible to trace back to the frame that generated the shiny using SWSH OWRNG GENERATOR GUI.</p>

   <p>This method is the most time consuming and luck dependent, and requires you to leave the game open immediately after capturing a shiny Pokémon.</p>

  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Finding TID/SID using CFW</h1>
</div><hr />

<p>As mentioned above, by having access to a CFW Switch console we can easily find our TID/SID combination. The method will differ slightly depending on if you are using a SysBot, or asking a friend to help.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that SysBot hosts are not constantly available. Join a public server that contains an active Sword/Shield bot, then follow the instructions given by the bot host. If you do not have a Discord account you will need to make one or ask a friend for help instead.</p>

<p>If you are unable to use a bot, or gain access to a console running Switch CFW, you will need to find a shiny Pokemon in the wild in order to find your TID/SID combination. This method should only really be used if you are unable to use the above method.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Finding a random shiny Pokémon via an overworld encounter</li>

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Tutorial:</span></h6>
    <ul>
      <li>Run around in the overworld and encounter Pokémon until a shiny Pokémon appears.</li>
      <li>Capture the Pokémon, then quickly pause the game after doing so in order to pause the RNG state.</li>
      <li>Identify your current seed using the <code span class="fw-bold">Retail Seed Finder</code> window, then click the <code span class="fw-bold">Search for TID/SID</code> checkbox on the main window.</li>
      <li>Enter your search range, this should be however many advancements you believe has occurred since you encountered the Pokémon (If the above steps were closely followed, this should be a few thousand advancements at maximum).</li>
      <li>Hit search, and find the frame that generated your shiny Pokémon. You should now also see the TID/SID combination that made the Pokémon shiny.</li>
      <li>Take note of these values, you will need them in order to hunt shiny Pokémon, and to avoid repeating this process every time.</li>
