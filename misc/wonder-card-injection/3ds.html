        <h6 span class="fw-bold">Setup &amp; Installation</h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Download <code class="fw-bold">PKHeX</code> and extract it to a known location on your computer, launch <code class="fw-bold">PKHeX.exe</code> and confirm that it opens properly with no issues.</li>
            <li>Download <code class="fw-bold">RunAsDate</code> and extract it to a known location on your computer, launch <code class="fw-bold">RunAsDate.exe</code> and confirm that it opens properly with no issues.</li>
            <li>Close PKHeX, you will now need to launch RunAsDate and select PKHeX as your program to launch.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Enter a time and date that matches your desired event distribution, this is an important step for legality purposes.</li>
                <li>You can find information about the distribution period of an event on <a href="https://projectpokemon.org/home/files/category/2-event-gallery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ProjectPokemon</a> or <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_event_Pok%C3%A9mon_distributions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bulbapedia</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Extract your 3DS save file and place it inside a known location on your computer, then open the save file using PKHeX (<code class="fw-bold">File -> Open -> Select the .sav file</code>).</li>
            <li>Open the Event Gallery repository and open the folder that corrisponds to your game generation.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you are injecting Wonder Cards into a Generation 6 game (XY/ORAS), open the <code class="fw-bold">Released/Gen 6/Wondercards</code> directory.</li>
                <li>If you are injecting Wonder Cards into a Generation 7 game (SM/USUM), open the <code class="fw-bold">Released/Gen 7/3DS/Wondercards</code> directory.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Select and download your desired Wonder Card. Check if your Wonder Card is Local Wireless/Infrared or serial Code/Nintendo Zone by researching the event on the <a href="https://projectpokemon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ProjectPokemon Website</a>.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If your Wonder Card was distributed locally or via infared, this generally means it can be injected into any save file regardless of region.</li>
                <li>If your Wonder Card was distributed via serial code or Nintendo Zone, this generally means that the event was region locked.</li>
                <li>For region locked events, ensure the console you'll be redeeming/performing the RNG on matches a legal Region for that given event Pok&eacute;mon. If doing this on Emulator, you can manually change &amp; set the Region for one that is legal in the settings before doing your RNG.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>At this stage it is assumed that you have launched PKHeX using RunAsDate on a date that matches the official distribution period and that your save file is opened and ready to be edited. It is also assumed that you have done your due diligence to ensure that the Wonder Card you plan to inject will be legal on the save file you are injecting into.</p>

        <h6 class="fw-bold">Step-by-step instructions</h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the save file in PKHeX if you have not already done so, then navigate to the <code class="fw-bold">SAV</code> tab above the box viewer.</li>
            <li>Click the <code class="fw-bold">Mystery Gift</code> button to open the Mystery Gift injection subwindow. This is where you will perform the injection.</li>
            <li>Click the <code class="fw-bold">Import</code> button, then select your chosen Wonder Card in the file explorer, you should now see your Wonder Card in the subwindow.</li>
            <li>Right-click an empty Wonder Card slot in the PGT row then click <code class="fw-bold">Set</code> to apply it to your save file. You can now press the <code class="fw-bold">Save</code> button to close the subwindow.</li>
            <li>Export your save file (<code class="fw-bold">File -> Export Sav</code>) and overwrite your existing save file, then load it back onto your cartridge/emulator.</li>
            <li>Visit the delivery man in-game. He can be found standing next to the desk/PC inside any Pok&eacute;mon Center.</li>

    <span class="fw-bold">Important -</span> <span class="fw-bold">Important -</span> In special cases, it is important to follow the proper in-game procedures rather than using shortcuts. For example, if you are injecting an egg Wonder Card and want to hatch it shiny on another save file, you should trade the egg between save files. Do not inject the .pk* file directly into the other save file, as this bypasses the intended game mechanics and may result in an illegal Pok&eacute;mon.
