</div><hr />

<p>This page covers how to inject WonderCards legally and safely in Generation 3-7 titles. A WonderCard is essentially a key to redeeming a specific event Pokemon, these "keys" are used to redeem a Pokemon from the Mystery Gift NPC found inside the PokeCenter or PokeMart.</p>

    <h5><span class="fw-bold">Required Tools:</span></h5>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://projectpokemon.org/home/files/file/1-pkhex/">PKHeX by Kaphotics</a></li>

      <li>A copy of the save file you wish to inject into.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Download and extract the executable (.exe) file of both PKHeX & Gen 3 WCTool into an empty folder then run the application you plan to use (see below)</p><hr />

      <p>If you are using an emulator, you will need to either save in game and locate where the save file data is stored, or export the save using the export function of the emulator (export as sav when possible).</p>

  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Getting Started</h1>
</div><hr />

<p>Before starting, understand that this guide is intended to be used for personal use/collection purposes only. If you plan to inject Wonder Cards to trade the Pokemon in a community, be sure to understand the community rules surrounding this topic. I will not be held responsible any punishments that occur as a result of trading or misinjecting Wonder Cards.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Back up the save file multiple times using one of the above mentioned guides & methods.</li><p></p>
      <li>Find your desired WonderCard using the <a href="https://github.com/projectpokemon/EventsGallery/tree/master/Released.">ProjectPokemon Event Gallery Repository</a>, then download the file to a known location on your computer.</li><p></p>
      <li>Verify the details of the event using the search bar on <a href="https://projectpokemon.org/">ProjectPokemon</a>, the event must match what is legally achievable (e.g Old Sea Map Mew is exclusive to Japan).</li><p></p>
      <li>Open the Gen 3 WCTool, then click <code span class="fw-bold">Official Event Distributor</span></code>, then open your extracted save file.</li><p></p>
      <li>If the region is incorrect when loading the save file, be sure to correct it now (see Old Sea Map Mew example)!</li><p></p>
      <li>Select the event to inject and click <code span class="fw-bold">Inject and Save</span></code>, then export the edited save and overwrite one of your existing save copies.</li><p></p>
      <li>Re-inject your save file onto your cartridge using your save manager/flashcart. You should now be able to complete the event as intended.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><span class="fw-bold">Tips -</span> You can also toggle the event flags needed using PKHeX, if you feel comfortable doing so, using the Gen 3 WCTool is considered to be a more foolproof solution as it automatically marks events that can be legally injected into your console/region.</p>

    <p><span class="fw-bold">Note -</span> In Gen 4 & 5, the language of the cart dictates what events can be legitimately injected (meaning an english distribution event can only be injected into an english game and so on).</p>

    <p><span class="fw-bold">Note -</span> In Gen 6 & 7, Local Wireless/Infrared Events are always region free, while serial Code/Nintendo Zone events are usually region locked.</p>
