    A guide to for safely injecting Pok&eacute;mon or items featured in limited time event distributions.

<h5 span class="fw-bold">Introduction</h5>
<p>"Wonder Cards" are essentially a key given to the game to allow a player to redeem a specific Pok&eacute;mon or item from an event distribution in Generation 3-9. This guide showcases how to inject Wonder Cards as safely as possible and outlines how to avoid any potential legality issues you may run into during this process.</p>

            <summary class="fw-bold mb-2">Why inject Wonder Cards?</summary>
            <p>Event distributions typically only run for a limited time, which means that after the event distribution period ends it becomes inaccessible through normal gameplay. For this reason, trusted community members dump and preserve the raw files used to generate event distributions so that players can access them even after the event distribution period has ended.</p>

        <details>
            <summary class="fw-bold mb-2">Is this considered legitimate?</summary>
            <p>The term "legitimate" is used to describe gameplay intended by the game developers. Since these methods require save editing in some way shape or form it is not considered legitimate by raw definition. However, injected Wonder Cards generate the Pok&eacute;mon or item the same way the game does, so you can draw your own conclusion about if you consider this method to be acceptable for your use case.</p>

        <details>
            <summary class="fw-bold mb-2">Can this be done on retail hardware?</summary>
            <p>No. At a minimum you will need a piece of hardware or Custom Firmware installed to extract your save file from the cartridge or console. Redeeming the event distribution can be done on retail hardware after editing your save file.</p>

        <details>
            <summary class="fw-bold mb-2">Does this hold any ban risk?</summary>
            <p>At the time of writing, there have been no reports of being banned or having their online access restricted from using any of the tools featured in this guide. That said, using homebrew always carries some risk, and you are responsible for any consequences that may occur. As long as you follow the steps carefully and use the tools responsibly you should not run into any issues.</p>

            <summary class="fw-bold mb-2">Does x trading community allow this method?</summary>
            <p>I do not know. Some communities may consider Pok&eacute;mon from injected event distributions to be fine for trading, while others may consider them to be illegitimate. Confirm the rules surrounding event injection in the community you participate in. I will not be held responsible for any community punishments that occur as a result of you trading Pok&eacute;mon obtained from injected Wonder Cards.</p>

<script>
    $("#gen-select").change(() => { // $ tells the script to use jQuerey, # tells jQuery that this element is an ID, .change(() => {...}) registers a function to the change event. An alternative to this in plain javascript would be document.getElementByID("content-select").addEventListener("change", () => {...});
        let optionValue = $("#gen-select").val(); // .val() asks jQuery to get the value of the selected option. This step looks up an element by its id, then gets the selected option, and stores it in the variable optionValue

        $(".info").addClass("d-none"); // . is a class identifier, so this step tells jQuery to get every element with the info class and add the class d-none to all of them. Vanilla js equivalent is to call document.getElementsByClassName("info") and then edit the classList.
        $(".info-" + optionValue).removeClass("d-none"); // combine "info-" with the optionValue from above and use it as a class identifier to get the element that we want to un-hide, then remove the d-none class from it. vanilla js should probably use document.querySelector() for this.
