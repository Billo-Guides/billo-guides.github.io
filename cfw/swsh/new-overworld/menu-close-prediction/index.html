<hr />

<p>This page contains information about calibrating your NPC count, and using that knowledge to grant yourself the best possible chance of hitting a target frame/Pokemon. Menu close prediction is used extensively throughout this guide, so it is very important to have an understanding of how to use the technique to your advantage.</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 1 -</span> Menu Close Demonstration<p></p>

<p>In Figure 1, the RNG tool is connected and the game is paused. The pause menu was then closed and reopened a few times, resulting in a number of advances being consumed each time (as shown in the image). This demonstrates the process of performing the menu close action.</p>

<p>Clicking the <code class="fw-bold">Consider Menu Close?</code> checkbox on the main window gains access to the <code class="fw-bold">Calibrate NPCs</code> button, clicking this button opens a sub-window, here is where we will determine the amount of NPCs currently active in our location.</p>

<p>Upon opening, we can see that the current seed and number of initial advancements have been entered automatically, if you have not yet filled in the Encounter Settings in the main window to match your desired target, you will need to manually set your weather condition.</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 3 -</span> Finding NPC Count<p></p>
<img src="/cfw/swsh/new-overworld/images/menu-close-prediction/finding-npc-count.gif" alt="menu-close-prediction-3" class="img-fluid clickable-image" data-image="/cfw/swsh/new-overworld/images/menu-close-prediction/finding-npc-count.gif"><p></p>

<p>After setting the appropriate weather condition and clicking "Search", a table will appear. Close and reopen the pause menu once, then note the number of advances consumed during this action (displayed in the main window). You will now need to take note of the <code class="fw-bold">Jump</code> column in the table, highlighted in red in the above image.</p>

<p>Change the value in the <code class="fw-bold">NPCs</code> field until we see the correct amount of advances in the first row of the table. In this example, 10 advances were consumed from closing and re-opening the pause menu, so we will tweak the NPCs field and click search until we see +10 advances inside the <code class="fw-bold">Jump</code> column of the table, which should then give us the current NPC count.</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 4 -</span> NPC Count Found<p></p>
<img src="/cfw/swsh/new-overworld/images/menu-close-prediction/npc-count-found.gif" alt="menu-close-prediction-4" class="img-fluid clickable-image" data-image="/cfw/swsh/new-overworld/images/menu-close-prediction/npc-count-found.gif"><p></p>

<p>The number of advances matches the expected value for an NPC count of 4. Close and reopen the pause menu a few more times while monitoring the number of consumed advances to ensure that the <code class="fw-bold">Jump</code> column of the table aligns correctly. This process will confirm that the calibrated NPC count is accurate.</p>

<p>After a few attempts, we can see that the jump value aligns with what is expected for an NPC count of 4. Keep in mind that NPC count is subject to change based on positioning and location, if you switch either of this two variables you will need to re-calibrate the NPC count.</p>

    <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Final Notes</h1>
</div><hr />

<ul>
    <li>In most cases, the RNG state will stop advancing for a few seconds after closing the pause menu, this window of silence makes for an extremely reliable and consistent method of hitting your target frame.</li><p></p>
    <li>NPC calibration will not work in wet weather, alter the weather by changing your system date if the current active weather is Rain or Thunderstorm. Weather can be changed back to its original state after calibrating NPC count.</li><p></p>
    <li>Holding a direction on your control stick will result in variation, it is not recommended to use direction hold when calibrating your NPC count, this feature is intended to be used for hitting target frames only.</li><p></p>
    <li>After entering your NPC count into the main window, then searching for a target, the search results will display the advance that you are expected to close the pause menu on in order to hit your target frame.</li>
</ul>

    <span class="fw-bold">Great!</span> You should now have a basic understanding of how to calibrate NPC counts, and how to apply that knowledge to accurately hit target frames (you can leave this page open for future reference).
