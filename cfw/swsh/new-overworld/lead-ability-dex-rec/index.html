    Understanding Pok&eacute;mon ability influences and Pok&eacute;dex recommendations to boost spawn rates.
</small>
<hr />

<p>This section explains advanced techniques involving the use of lead abilities and the using Pok&eacute;dex recommendation feature. These methods are used to influence the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The details of a spawned Pok&eacute;mon (e.g., nature and gender).</li>
    <li>The probability of spawning a particular Pok&eacute;mon in the encounter table.</li>
    <li>Increasing the likelihood of triggering a hidden encounter.</li>
</ul>

<p>This table provides information about each of the lead abilities and their use cases:</p>

    Synchronize is the only ability usable after the Pok&eacute;mon spawns; all others must be active beforehand. A fainted lead allows your capture Pok&eacute;mon enter battle directly, removing the need to consume a turn by switching the Pok&eacute;mon in.

<small class="text-muted mb-3 mt-0">
    It is recommended to complete your Pok&eacute;dex before using this method.
</small>
<hr />

<p>Upon opening the Pok&eacute;dex, you should see up to 4 Pok&eacute;mon at a specific location on the map. These Pok&eacute;mon have an increased spawn rate anywhere in the world as long as they are in the current encounter table. The order they are listed on the bottom right of the screen is from #1-#4 for the purpose of RNG manipulation. This feature is commonly referred to as "Pok&eacute;dex Recommendations" or "DexRec".</p>

<p>If you have not yet looked at your Pok&eacute;dex, or the date has naturally rolled over or date skipping has been used since the last time the Pok&eacute;dex was opened, the current DexRec is considered inactive until you look at the Pok&eacute;dex again.</p>

<div class="alert alert-danger" style="border: 1px solid #b60606; border-radius: 8px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8d7da; color: #721c24;">
    For incomplete Pok&eacute;dexes, the recommendations you will see will prioritize Pok&eacute;mon that you have not yet captured. Completing the Pok&eacute;dex will cause the game to boost random Pok&eacute;mon, it is suggested to complete your Pok&eacute;dex before rolling DexRec.

        <p>In the above example, NidoranF (#1), Sinistea (#2), Heatmor (#3) and Magby (#4) are the currently boosted Pok&eacute;mon. Although the DexRec was triggered in Old Cemetery, these Pok&eacute;mon will have their spawn rate boosted globally regardless of the current area, as long as the boosted Pok&eacute;mon is present within an encounter table.</p>

        <p>Only the first form ID of a particular Pok&eacute;mon will be boosted. For example, if our currently boosted Pok&eacute;mon is Sinistea the spawn rate boost will only apply to the Phony form (the first form ID for Sinistea). This means that Sinistea-Antique cannot have an encounter rate boost from DexRec at all.</p>

        <p>For Pok&eacute;mon can only be found in specific weather conditions, you will first need to find the location of your desired Pok&eacute;mon, then set the weather condition <u>in that area</u> to match the required weather needed to spawn the Pok&eacute;mon (example below). Owoows <code span class="fw-bold">Encounter Lookup</code> feature can be used to quickly find details about a particular Pok&eacute;mon.</p>

            <summary><span class="fw-bold">Example:</span></summary>
            <p>If your desired DexRec is Drampa, which is found in the Lake of Outrage in Thunderstorm weather, you will need to change the current weather condition in the Lake of Outrage to Thunderstorm.</p>

        <h6 span class="fw-bold">Step-By-Step:</h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Stand in any of the Wild Areas, then use the Encounter Lookup feature of owoow to search for your desired Pok&eacute;mon.</li>
            <li>Take note of the location that contains your desired Pok&eacute;mon, and the weather condition required to spawn it.</li>
            <li>Change the date within the System Settings until you get the desired weather condition in the correct location.</li>
            <li>View the Pok&eacute;dex to activate your daily dex recommendations, if this is not what you want, exit back into the overworld.</li>
            <li>Use date skipping method to reset daily events, then view the Pok&eacute;dex again, repeat until you have achieved your desired DexRec.</li>
        </ol>

        <h6 span class="fw-bold">About Date Skipping:</h6>
        <p>DexRec is cleared after a day advances. You can change the date freely as long as you don't do the actual advance, but for obvious reasons, you cannot combine DexRec boosting and date skipping advancements.</p>

        <p>If you are not using date skipping, roll your desired DexRec and save the game, take note of the date the game has been saved on to avoid unintentionally rolling the current recommendations due to natural time progression.</p>

    DexRec rolling is deterministic. If you roll 100 days, then reset and roll another 100 days, you will see the same results both times. You should save after you roll even if you did not get your desired DexRec.
