    Worked examples for manipulating Static encounters in any weather condition.

<hr />

<p>Static spawners consistently produce the same species until the weather in the area changes, which can occur at midnight (00:00). Be mindful of the current system time to avoid spawning unexpected Pokemon due to incorrect weather conditions.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Select <code span class="fw-bold">Encounter Lookup</code> from the toolbar at the top of the main window of owoow to open the sub-window.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Select a game version on the right, then type the species name of your desired Pokemon and select an encounter.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Take note of the encounter type, location and weather condition, then enter this information into the <code span class="fw-bold">Encounter Settings</code> column of the main window.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Set your search range (the <code span class="fw-bold">+</code> field in <code span class="fw-bold">Encounter Settings</code>), select a lead ability, then set your search filters. You can filter for Shiny, Mark, IVs, Height, etc.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Fly to the correct location in-game, then locate the spawner that contains your desired Pokemon. After doing so, run far enough away to despawn it and save the game.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Type your IP address into owoow, then click the <code span class="fw-bold">Connect</code> button while standing in the overworld (ideally with the game paused), then begin searching for target frames.</li>
        </ol>

        <details>
            <summary span class="fw-bold">Undesirable search result?</summary>
            <p>Increase your search range. Alternatively, restart the game and disconnect/reconnect to owoow, this will give you a fresh initial seed. You can also use owoow's Reset For Seed feature to automate the process of searching for a desirable seed.</p>

        <p>If you have not already done so, locate the spawner that contains your desired Pokemon in game, stand far away enough to completely despawn it, then save the game. You can tell if you are far enough away from the spawner by walking into it and looking for a dust cloud at the foot of the Pokemon. If you do not see a dust cloud, you are standing too close.</p>

        <p>The above location in Giant's Seat is ideal: no additional spawned Pokemon, no active NPCs, and Giant's Seat is notably "quiet" during calm weather conditions. A "quiet" area refers to an environment where the RNG naturally advances at a slow pace.</p>

        <p>If you cannot find a good position, you can knock out any extra Static Pokemon blocking your path. These will remain despawned until the date is changed, the area is refreshed by entering a loading zone, or the game is rebooted after a date advance.</p>

<p>Instructions for hitting a target frame depend on the selected weather condition. Rain and Thunderstorm are considered "advanced" and may be challenging for beginners. If this is your first time attempting this type of RNG manipulation, it is recommended to start with a different weather condition to familiarize yourself with the general process.</p>
