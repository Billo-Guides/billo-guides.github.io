<p>The SwSh Overworld RNG Tool tracks the amount of advances that have occured since the initial connection to the program. Advancements can occur naturally based on the overworld environment, or can be forced by performing specific actions. The most useful actions can be found here.</p>

        <span class="fw-bold text-light">Advancement Method - Animations</span>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>When viewing the Pokemon party list, pressing the <code class="fw-bold">L3</code> button causes the RNG state to advance by +1 with each press. Similarly, selecting a Pokemon and viewing the summary screen, then pressing the <code class="fw-bold">L3</code> button advances the RNG state by +1 per animation (slower). Using the party list is the recommended method for performing this action.</p>

        <p>The primary use of this action is to provide a consistent and predictable way to advance toward a specific frame or RNG state, as each action advances the RNG state by exactly +1.</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 2 -</span> Player Movement Example<p></p>

        <span class="fw-bold text-light">Advancement Method - Player Movement</span>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>Player movement involves either moving the control stick or making the player whistle by pressing the R3 button. This type of RNG advancement can also be performed while riding the bike.</p>

        <p>The primary purpose of this action is to fine-tune progression (or inch closer) toward a target frame, particularly when more precise and predictable methods such as closing the pause menu, are insufficient for landing on a desired frame.</p>
    </div>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 3 -</span> Menu Close Example<p></p>

        <span class="fw-bold text-light">Advancement Method - Menu Close</span>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>Closing the pause menu advances the RNG state based in a predictable manner based on the number of NPCs in the area. Do note that an NPC does not need to be visible in the overworld to contribute to the NPC total, so this method will require the player to calibrate the number of NPCs manually. How to accurately calibrate your current NPC count will be explained in detail later.</p>

        <p>This action also temporarily freezes RNG advancements for a brief period in most cases, in tandem with being predictable, this makes for the most consistent method of hitting the desired target frame. As a result of the effectiveness of this method, menu close prediction will be referenced often throughout the guide.</p>

        <span class="fw-bold text-light">Advancement Method - Bike Mount</span>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>Mounting and dismounting the bike advances the RNG state by a small amount. The exact number of advancements is variable and depends on the number of NPCs currently in the area and Pokemon in your party, amount of advancements consumed is not currently predictable.</p>

        <p>This method is useful for advancing smaller distances more quickly; however, it is not recommended for landing on exact target frames due to the variability and unpredictability of the advancements.</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 5 -</span> NPC Activation Example<p></p>

        <span class="fw-bold text-light">Advancement Method - NPC Activation</span>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>Standing next to an NPC causes them to become "active" and face the player (as shown in the image above). When this occurs, the RNG state advances rapidly until the player moves far enough away to deactivate the NPC.</p>

        <p>This method is effective for advancing medium to large distances quickly, as it consumes approximately 2,500 advancements per minute per NPC. Additionally, multiple active NPCs can be stacked, with more active NPCs resulting in a higher number of advancements per minute.</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 6 -</span> Rain/Thunderstorm Weather Example<p></p>

        <span class="fw-bold text-light">Advancement Method - Rain/Thunderstorm</span>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>Changing the weather to, or moving into an area with rain/thunderstorm causes the RNG state to advance rapidly. These rapid advancements will continue until the weather in the area changes or the player moves to a different area where it is no longer raining.</p>

        <p>Advancing in rainy weather is one of the most efficient methods for covering large distances of advancements quickly. This method can also be combined with active NPCs to further increase the number of advancements per minute, potentially reaching upwards of 10,000 advances per minute.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>The <code span class="fw-bold">Skip</code> feature of the RNG tool artificially adjusts the Switch system clock, which advances the RNG state rapidly. The number of advancements consumed per day skipped varies based on the number of Pok√©mon currently stored in boxes (excluding eggs). With optimal box management, it is possible to consume more than 15,000 advancements per day skipped.</p>
