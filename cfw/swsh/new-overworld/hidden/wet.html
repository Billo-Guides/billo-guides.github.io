        <h6 span class="fw-bold">What Are Rain Ticks?</h6>
        <p>Rain Ticks refer to the RNG advances that occur when Rain or Thunderstorm are the active weather condition. The advances are used to randomly place raindrops on screen. Despite the sheer speed of RNG advances caused by wet weather, the number of advances remains predictable through proper calibration. We will perform this calibration using the <code class="fw-bold">Advanced Settings</code> column in the main window.</p>

        <p>For accuracy and stability, calibrate your Rain Ticks using encounters that spawn in a single step. Each step taken in grass causes a specific number of Rain Ticks, which appears to depend on your current location. The number of steps required to trigger a Hidden encounter is listed in the <code span class="fw-bold">Step</code> column of the search result table.</p>

        <h6 span class="fw-bold">Rain Tick Calibration</h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Position yourself optimally (see Figure 2 for a visual reference), then change the weather to anything that is NOT Rain or Thunderstorm. Check the weather by opening the map, then save and reboot the game.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Immediately pause the game and calibrate your NPC count as usual. Once calibrated, close the <code class="fw-bold">MenuCloseTimeline</code>, enter your NPC count in the main window. Then place a Pok&eacute;mon with No Guard, Illuminate, or Arena Trap in the lead slot of your party.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Set the weather back to Rain or Thunderstorm (verify this by opening the map). then save and reboot the game once more for stability purposes, pause the game immediately after entering the overworld.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>On owoow, set the weather to Rain or Thunderstorm, then confirm that the NPC count is correctly entered in the main window and that the checkboxes for <code span class="fw-bold">Consider Menu Close?</code>, <code span class="fw-bold">Holding Direction?</code>, and <code span class="fw-bold">Rain Ticks</code> are enabled.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>You should have the game paused in the overworld at this stage. Open the Pok&eacute;mon party list, disconnect and reconnect to owoow, and set your current advances to 0. This step is important for accurate calibration.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Exit the party list to return to the main pause menu. Hold a direction on your control stick (ensuring it causes the player to walk in the grass), then unpause the game and take a step in grass to trigger a Hidden encounter.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>The goal is to trigger an encounter in a single step. If no encounter appears or it takes multiple steps to spawn a Hidden encounter in the overworld, reboot the game and try again.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Once the encounter is triggered, enter battle quickly before it despawns. Then, click the <code class="fw-bold">Read Encounter</code> button, followed by <code class="fw-bold">Copy IVs to Filters</code>. Enter the encountered Pok&eacute;mon's species in the <code class="fw-bold">Encounter Settings</code> section if necessary.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>In <code span class="fw-bold">Advanced Settings</code>, click <code span class="fw-bold">Calculate Rain Ticks</code>. If done correctly, a result will appear. Enter the calibrated value into the <code span class="fw-bold">Rain Ticks</code> field. In most cases, this value should be 20 or lower.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The calibration checkboxes (<code class="fw-bold">Consider Menu Close?</code>, <code class="fw-bold">Holding Direction?</code>, and <code class="fw-bold">Rain Ticks</code>) account for frames consumed when leaving the Pok&eacute;mon party list and closing the main pause menu. The search results table will display the exact frame at which you should close the party list and main pause menu to then spawn your target Pok&eacute;mon in the overworld.</p>

    <span class="fw-bold">Troubleshooting -</span> If multiple possible results appear during calibration, repeat the process a few times or adjust your position slightly until you find a consistent Rain Tick value. If you see "No results found", this is likely to be user error. Double-check each step and try again, ensuring you follow the instructions carefully.

        <span class="fw-bold text-light">Advancing to the Target</span>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>The recommended method for advancing the RNG state is to perform all advances in the pause menu, this can be done using <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/overworld/advancing-rng-state/wet-weather-menuing.gif">wet weather menuing</a> and <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/overworld/advancing-rng-state/animations.gif">animations</a>. These methods advance the RNG state slowly but offer the highest consistency between attempts. Advancing in the overworld will cause Rain Tick instability, do this at your own risk.</p>

        <p>In this example, a Shiny, Weather Mark Elekid appears in a {% include tooltips/clusters.html %} from advances 3,484-3,488. The calibrated NPC count is 4 and the current Rain Tick value is 20, and a direction on the control stick should be held while unpausing as this provides extra consistency between attempts.</p>

        <h6 class="fw-bold">Step-by-Step:</h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Confirm that the <code class="fw-bold">Consider Menu Close?</code> &amp; <code class="fw-bold">Holding Direction?</code> boxes have been checked, and that your NPC count and Rain Ticks have been entered properly.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Advance towards your target using wet weather menuing or animations until you are ~100 advances away, then open the Pok&eacute;mon party list.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Disconnect and re-connect to owoow and search for your target again, this will reset your current advances to 0.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Use animations to advance to your new target frame. Each <code class="fw-bold">L3</code> button input on the party list advances the RNG state by +1 (e.g., 100 inputs = 100 advances).</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Back out from the party list into the main pause menu, then hold a direction on your control stick, hold a direction that will cause you to take a step in the grass.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Quickly initiate the encounter before it despawns and verify the result matches expectations, spawned Hidden encounters disappear within a few seconds.</li>
        </ol>
