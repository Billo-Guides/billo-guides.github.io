    Worked examples for manipulating Hidden encounters in any weather condition.

<hr />

<p class="fw-bold" style="color: #c00000;">HIDDEN RNG SHOULD ONLY BE USED IF NO OTHER OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE FOR YOUR TARGET POKEMON, PICK A DIFFERENT ENCOUNTER TYPE WHERE POSSIBLE. HIDDEN RNG MAY TAKE MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS BEFORE HITTING A RESULT!</p>

<p>The species produced in a Hidden spawner is determined by a random value known as an "encounter-slot", this value ranges from 0-99 to decide which Pokemon in the encounter table will spawn. The Pokemon that can be found in the encounter table will remain the same until the weather in the area changes, which can occur at midnight (00:00). Be mindful of the current system time to avoid spawning unexpected Pokemon due to incorrect weather conditions.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>In the main window, type your consoles IP address then click <code class="fw-bold">Connect</code>, connecting to the program will read your current seed and save file details automatically.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Select <code class="fw-bold">Encounter Lookup</code> from the toolbar at the top to open the sub-window, then type the name of your desired species and search for a HIDDEN encounter.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Close the <code class="fw-bold">Encounter Lookup</code> window, then enter the relevant Location, Weather &amp; Species information into the <code class="fw-bold">Encounter Settings</code> section of the main window.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Select your lead ability, for hidden encounters it is recommended to use an ability that triggers the liklihood of spawning a hidden encounter (e.g, No Guard).</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Adjust your search range (the <code class="fw-bold">+</code> field in <code class="fw-bold">Encounter Settings</code>), then configure your search filters such as filtering for Shiny, Mark, IVs, or Height.</li>

        <ol>
            <li>Remove any Pokemon that are currently stored in the {% include tooltips/daycare.html %} then fly to the required location and stand inside the largest patch of grass in the area that you can find, you should be facing outwards towards the grass.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>If you are standing with spawned Pokemon that are aggressive (i.e, charge towards the player), you can try changing the weather condition to spawn Pokemon that will be less problematic/more docile.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>After you are standing in the correct position, set the required weather condition in-game by changing the date, the spawned Pokemon will remain the same until they are despawned.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Dismount your bike if you are riding it, then save the game. Hidden encounters are much less likely to spawn if you are riding your bike, even when using an encounter boosting lead ability.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Once you are positioned correctly, add your desired lead Pokemon to your party and then save the game once more. Detailed information about lead abilities and their use cases can be found by clicking the button below.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>In the vast majority of cases you will be forced to stand with extra spawned wild Pokemon, these Pokemon can cause extra unwanted advances when trying to hit a target frame. How to manage this issue will vary depending on your chosen weather condition and will be explained as you progress through this page.</p>

<hr />

<p>The instructions for hitting a target frame depend on the selected weather condition. Rain and Thunderstorm are considered "advanced" and may be challenging for beginners. If this is your first time attempting this type of RNG manipulation it is recommended to start with a different weather condition to familiarize yourself with the general process.</p>
