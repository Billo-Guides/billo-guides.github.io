<p>The <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/item/main-page/cram-o-matic.jpg">Cram-o-Matic machine</a> is located inside the Dojo on the Isle of Armor, and can be unlocked through story progression. Once you have unlocked access to the machine, you can "feed" it items from your bag to generate items, such as the rare Apricorn, Safari &amp; Sport Balls or Ribbon &amp; Star sweets for Alcremie. Rare items will be the main focus of this guide as most other items can be obtained through different, more accessible means.</p>
