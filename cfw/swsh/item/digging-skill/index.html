<p>The <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/item/main-page/digging-bro-skill.jpg">Digging Bro</a> NPCs is located at Bridge Field in the Wild Area within close proximity of the Wild Area nursery. Both brothers will be standing next to each other, the NPC we will be performing the manipulation on can be found on the left. In exchange for Watts this NPC will dig up valuable items for you such as (Gold) Bottle Caps, Fossils, and sellable items.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Enter the IP address of your console in the main window and click <code class="fw-bold">Connect</code>. This will automatically read your current seed and save file details.</li>
            <li>Set the weather in the <code class="fw-bold">Encounter Settings</code> section of the main owoow window to the current weather condition in the Bridge Field.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid using Rain/Thunderstorm. These weather conditions are not supported as they are unnecessarily more difficult for no advantage.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>At the top of the main owoow window, click <code class="fw-bold">Digging Bro (Skill)</code> to open the Digging Bro generator in a subwindow.</li>
            <li>Enter your search filters, this will involve individually setting your desired items and item quantity:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><code class="fw-bold">Min Total Rewards</code> should be set to the bare minimum amount of items you would accept. By default this is set to 5.</li>
                <li>Any other filter is the quantity of each item you would accept, the more strict the filters are the less likely you are to find a result.</li>
                <li>It is recommended to target high quantities (e.g, 5) of a specific item instead of searching for a seed that produces medium quantites of multiple items.</li>
                <li>For example, finding a seed that will produce 5 Fossilized Drake is more common than finding a seed that produces 3 of each individual Fossil.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Enter the number of advances you want to search in the <code class="fw-bold"></code>+ field, this number can be set higher or lower depending on the rarity of the seed you are looking for.</li>
            <li>Set the correct <a class="clickable-link">weather condition<a> if you have not already done so. This should have imported into the Digging Bro subwindow automatically if you followed step 2.</li>
            <li>Tick the <code class="fw-bold">Consider Menu Close?</code> checkbox, but do not calibrate your NPC count yet as we require a specific in-game setup, which will be explained below.</li>

        <ol>
            <li>Head to the location in Bridge Field pictured above. If this is your first time, interact with Skill Brother (left NPC) at least once to complete the introduction.</li>
            <li>Verify the weather condition by opening the map. If the current weather is Rain/Thunderstorm, change the date so the weather is anything calm.</li>
            <li>Move far enough away so that the NPC deactivates. You can tell if you are positioned correctly if he turns away and resumes his idle animation.</li>
            <li>Now you will need to position yourself optimally. This is done with a movement technique that disrupts the NPCs "activation":</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Run towards the NPC and immediately interact with him in one quick, smooth motion. Then, back out of the NPC dialogue.</li>
                <li>If you did this <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/item/watt-trader/correct-setup.gif">correctly</a>, you should see the RNG advances occurring at a slow, steady rate after backing out of the dialogue.</li>
                <li>If you did this <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/item/watt-trader/incorrect-setup.gif">incorrectly</a>, the NPC will activate after backing out of the dialogue, causing the usual, extremely fast NPC activation advances we normally use for advancing the RNG state.</li>
                <li>You should retry until the NPC is in the correct state. If you failed, move away until he becomes inactive, then try again. It may take a few attempts to get the NPC into the correct state, but this provides the most stable experience possible for this type of RNG manipulation.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Once the NPC is in the correct state, calibrate your menu NPC count as usual. The NPC count when standing next Digging Bro may change by the day. Enter your calibrated NPC count in the Digging Bro subwindow on owoow.</li>
            <li>Save the game. This will preserve the current deactivated NPC state through resets. The menu NPC count will also remain long as you reopen the game on the same date or an earlier date.</li>
            <li>You can now begin searching for target frames, if you do not find a desirable result consider increasing your search range, applying less strict search filters, or restarting the game and disconnecting/reconnecting to owoow to get a new seed.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>New seeds can be automatically applied to the sub window by clicking the <code class="fw-bold">Update Seeds</code> button on the main window.</li>

        <p>In this example, a frame that produces 1x Gold Bottle Cap, 2x Fossilized Dino, 1x Fossilized Bird and 4x Rare Bone can be seen in a {% include tooltips/clusters.html %} from advances 49,819-49,820. We will aim to close the <code class="fw-bold">X Menu</code> on these advances, then quickly interact with the NPC to lock in our desired result.</p>

        <h6 class="fw-bold">Step-by-Step</h6>
        <ol>
            <li>As we need to maintain our current positioning, advance towards the target using any method that does not cause the player to move.</li>

                <li>If your target is over 10,000 advances away, consider using <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/overworld/advancing-rng-state/wet-weather.gif">wet weather</a> or <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/overworld/advancing-rng-state/date-skipping.gif">date skipping</a>.</li>
                <li>For closer targets, consider using <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/overworld/advancing-rng-state/bike-mount.gif">bike hopping</a> or <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/overworld/advancing-rng-state/menu-close.gif">menu close</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Stop advancing once you are ~200-500 advances before your target.</li>
            <li>Open the <code class="fw-bold">X Menu</code> to pause the game.</li>
            <li>Click <code class="fw-bold">Update Seeds</code> on the main window of owoow to send your current seed into the active subwindow.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Ensure that the <code class="fw-bold">Consider Menu Close?</code> checkbox is checked in the Digging Bro subwindow, and confirm that your NPC count has been calibrated and entered correctly. Search for your target again.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Do not use the <code class="fw-bold">Holding Direction?</code> checkbox on owoow. Attempting to use direction hold will cause the NPC to activate and you will miss your target frame.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>From this point, use <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/overworld/advancing-rng-state/animations.gif">attack animations</a> to reach the exact target frame.</li>
            <li>Close the Pok&eacute;mon window so you are on the main <code class="fw-bold">X Menu</code>.</li>
            <li>Unpause the game by pressing <code class="fw-bold">B</code>. Do not touch the joystick when unpausing or you can lose the deactivated NPC state.</li>
            <li>Quickly interact with Digging Bro to lock in your items. Agree to trade him Watts and click A until the minigame has concluded.</li>

<p>In Figure 4, we closed the <code class="fw-bold">X Menu</code> on the desired target frame and quickly interacted with Digging Bro. Now we need to select <code class="fw-bold">Dig for me!</code> to start the minigame, which should produce the expected reward once you are done clicking.</p>
