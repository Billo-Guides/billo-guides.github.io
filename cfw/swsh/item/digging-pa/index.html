<p>The <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/item/main-page/digging-pa.jpg">Digging Pa</a> NPC is located on the north side of the Isle of Armor. Interacting with him gives you the option to trade Armorite Ore in return for attempts at his minigame, where you can earn a large amount of Watts.</p>

            <li>Head to the above location in the Isle of Armor, and interact with the Digging Pa at least once to gain access to the fly point.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Fly into the area (this will priovide optimal positioning), and knock out the spawned static Pokemon that is behind you.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Re-position yourself similarly to Figure 1, ensure that you have a clear, straight line between the player and the Digging Pa.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Check your current weather condition by opening the map, and calibrate your NPC count accordingly (do not use Rain/Thunderstorm for obvious reasons).</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Save the game.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The NPC count in the Isle of Armor is variable, you will need to re-calibrate your NPC count if the date has naturally advanced or you have reloaded the area after a date advance.</p>

            <li>Enter the IP address of your console in the main window and click <code class="fw-bold">Connect</code>. This will automatically read your current seed and save file details.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>At the top of the main owoow window, select <code class="fw-bold">Digging Pa</code> to open the Digging Pa generator in a sub-window.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Enter the amount of advances you are willing to search through into the <code class="fw-bold">+</code> field, usually you will find a result that produces 500,000 Watts in less than 10,000 advances.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Set the correct weather condition, this is important for accurate search results then using menu close prediction, as the Digging Pa is located outside.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Activate the <code class="fw-bold">Consider Menu Close?</code> checkbox, then enter the NPC count that was calibrated earlier. You can now begin searching for targets.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If you do not find a desirable result you will need to increase your search range, reset the game and follow the above steps again, or apply less strict search filters.</p>

    <span class="fw-bold">Important -</span> It is important to understand how NPC activation works. When standing next to an NPC it takes them a moment to notice you and become "activated", which will cause the speed of advances to increase. If you interact with the NPC before they notice you, you can avoid "activating" them. The goal is to avoid activating NPCs when attempting to hit your target frame.

<p>In Figure 3 we have activated the NPC, which means we interacted with them too slowly and this has caused unwanted advances to occur.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold">Figure 4 -</span> NPC Example (No Advances) &#9989;</p>

<p>In Figure 4 we interacted with the NPC quick enough that they did not become active, this is what we are aiming for when attempting to hit target frames.</p>

        <p>In this example, a frame that produces a 520,000~ Watts can be seen in a {% include tooltips/clusters.html %} between advances 982-984, these are the advances that we will aim to close the pause menu on, then quickly interact with the Digging Pa NPC using the method shown in Figure 4. It is only important to interact with the NPC on this frame to lock our Watts in place.</p>

        <h6 class="fw-bold">Step-by-Step</h6>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Advance toward your target using any of the methods listed on <a href="/cfw/swsh/new-overworld/advancing-the-rng-state" target="_blank">this page</a>.
                <p></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Consider using <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/overworld/advancing-rng-state/wet-weather.gif">wet weather</a> or <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/overworld/advancing-rng-state/date-skipping.gif">date skipping</a> to advance large distances (for targets > 100,000 advances, it is unlikely you will need to use this).</li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li>Consider using <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/overworld/advancing-rng-state/npc-activation.gif">NPC activation</a> or <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/overworld/advancing-rng-state/menu-close.gif">menu close prediction</a> to advance shorter distances (for targets < 100,000 advances, most targets will be less than this).</li>
                </ul>
                <p></p>
            <li>Stop advancing once you are ~1000 advances before your target, then reposition yourself optimally as shown in Figure 1 if you have moved.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Ensure that the <code class="fw-bold">Consider Menu Close?</code> checkbox is checked in the Digging Pa sub-window, and confirm that your NPC count is calibrated correctly.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Click <code class="fw-bold">Update Seeds</code> on the main window of owoow, then re-open the Digging Pa sub-window and search for your target again.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>From this point, use <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/overworld/advancing-rng-state/animations.gif">animations</a> to reach the exact target frame, then return to the main pause menu.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Unpause the game. If <code class="fw-bold">Holding Direction?</code> is checked, hold a direction on the control stick when unpausing; otherwise, do not touch the control stick when unpausing.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Move towards the Digging Pa NPC quickly using the method shown in Figure 4, interact with them to lock your Watt result in place, then click <code class="fw-bold">Dig me up some Watts</code> to produce the expected result.</li>

<p>In Figure 6 we closed the pause menu on the desired target frame and quickly interacted with the Digging PA before they became active, now we need to select <code class="fw-bold">Dig me up some Watts</code> to start the minigame, which should produce the expected reward.</p>
