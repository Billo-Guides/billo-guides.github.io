This portion of the guide will cover the process of RNG abusing the Cram-o-matic and the PC lottery function in Sword/Shield using the SWSH Overworld RNG Generator by <a href="https://github.com/LegoFigure11LegoFigure11">LegoFigure11</a>. 
Item RNG abuse is best utilized to help players obtain rare/valuable items such as rare Pokeballs!<br /> <br />

<span class="fw-bold">This guide assumes you are using a CFW Switch console running Atmosphere.</span><br /> <br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Getting Started:</span></h3>
<u>You will need:</u>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/LegoFigure11/swsh-overworld-rng-gui/releases">SWSH Overworld RNG Generator</a> - Latest release</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/Koi-3088/sys-usb-botbase/releases">sys-usb-botbase</a> - Latest release</li> 
  <li><a href="https://github.com/spacemeowx2/ldn_mitm/releases/">ldn-mitm</a> - Latest release</li> 
</ul>

<u>Installation Instructions:</u>
<ol>
  <li>Download and extract all the contents from the <code>SWSH_OWRNG_Generator_GUI.zip</code> into an empty folder.</li>
  <li>Download and extract all the contents from the sys-usb-botbase and ldn-mitm downloads into an empty folder.</a></li>
  <li>Place the <code>atmosphere</code> folder(s) from these downloads onto the root of your Switch SD card and reboot the console.</li>
  <li>Check the <code>/atmosphere/contents</code> directory of your SD card for two folders named <code>430000000000000B</code> & <code>4200000000000010</code>.</li>
  <li>Reboot your Switch console and launch CFW.</li>
</ol>

<u>In-game setup:</u>
<ul>
  <li>Have the Rotom PC lottery function & Cram-o-matic available for use.</li>
  <li>If you plan to RNG abuse the Cram-o-matic, have at least 4 apricorns to use in the machine.</li>
  <li>Stand next to the machine you want to work on.</li>
  <li>Press the Home button on your controller, click <code>Connect</code> on the main window of the tool.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Advancing the RNG state:</span></h3>
<u>Multiple in-game actions can be used to advance the RNG state with varying influence, these include:</u>
<ol>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Player movement -</span> Each time the player stops moving the control stick the RNG state will advance a small amount - Roughly 1-3 advancements & a spammable action.</li><br />
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Menu close -</span> Opening and closing the pause menu will advance the RNG state a small amount depending on your location and amount of NPCs present. - Predictable advancements & a spammable action.</li><br />
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Animations -</span> You can make your Pokemon animate on the party summary screen by pressing in the left stick. - 1 advancment per "click" & a spammable action.</li><br />
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Active NPCs -</span> Standing near an NPC will "activate" them, this will advance the RNG state rapidly. - Area specific advancements, good for covering large amounts of advancements quickly.</li><br />
</ol>

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Day Skipping:</span></h3>
We can use the <code>DaySkip</code> feature of the tool to advance the RNG state rapidly, up to a total of around 13,000 advancements per day skipped. The amount of frames that advance by Day Skipping is heavily influenced by the amount of Pokémon currently in your boxes, the number will increase drastically if you store more Pokémon. <u>Does not include Pokémon in eggs</u>.<br /><br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Menu Close Prediction:</span></h3>
We can use the <code>Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> to accurately predict the amount of advancements that will pass from closing the pause menu, this is based on the amount of NPCs in the building and if you were holding a direction on the control stick at the time of unpause.<br /><br /> 

<u>Here's how it's done:</u><br />
- Connect to the generator.<br />
- Click the <code>Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> button at the top of the generator to open a smaller window. If you have already connected to the generator you should see your current seeds already in the correct fields.<br />
- Calculate the amount of NPCs in the building manually, note down the number into the <code>NPCs</code> field. (This includes Pokemon "NPCs")<br />
- Enter your number of advancements into the <code>Init Adv.</code> field, as seen on the main window of the generator. (Starting from 0 advances is recommended)<br />
- Enter the search range into the <code>+</code> field directly below and search, you should then do a few menu close advancements to make sure the prediction is accurate.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Closing the pause menu has an added effect of freezing noise in the area for a short time period</span>, we will use this window of silence in tandem with menu close prediction to near guarantee that we interact with the machine on the correct frame. (More on this below!)<br /><br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Time to get to work! </span></h3>
The goal is to interact with the Cram-o-matic on the calculated target frame given to us by the <code>Cram-o-matic</code> tab of the generator. We will be using the advancement methods listed at the top of the page. <u>dayskip</u>, <u>menuing</u> and <u>player movement</u> advances will be used for this example.<br /><br />

If you plan to use the <code>DaySkip</code> feature you should take note of how many frames advance per day skipped to ensure that you don't overshoot your target.<br /><br />

In this example we will be aiming for a 5 Level Balls. You can be more specific with the filters if you wish, such as filtering for a specific rare items.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 1 -</span> Tool setup<br />
<img src="./images/cram-o-matic/figure-1-tool-setup-cram.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Awesome, everything looks good!</span> We can see our current seeds on the <code>Cram-o-matic</code> tab and have our filters set properly. Time to stand near the Cram-o-matic!<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 2 -</span> Game setup<br />
<img src="./images/cram-o-matic/figure-2-game-setup-cram.jpg" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

Once the <code>Cram-o-matic</code> tab is filled in correctly with  you can begin looking for target frames by clicking the search button.<br /><br />

<u>If your results are not desirable, repeat the following:</u>
<ol>
  <li>Disconnect your Switch from the tool.</li>
  <li>Restart your game and enter the overworld.</li>
  <li>Enter the pause or Home menu and reconnect your Switch to the tool.</li>
  <li>Search again, do this until you have desirable results.</li>
</ol>
  
<span class="fw-bold">We found a target frame!</span> 5 Level Balls on advance 795. This is the frame we will press A to initiate the Cram-o-matic. The RNG state will not advance during the menus, you can safely press B if you miss and then begin looking for a new target.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure  3 -</span> Target found!<br />
<img src="./images/cram-o-matic/figure-3-target-found-cram.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />
  
We'll want to exit the pause menu as close to the target frame as possible in order to freeze the noise in the area, then use rapid player movement advances to hit our target frame and finally, interact with the cram-o-matic on this frame.<br /><br />
  
Here's a more fleshed out example...<br /><br />
<ul>
  <li>The target is 795 advances away, delay is 0, and there are 20 NPCs in the building, this information has been entered into the <code>Retail Menu Advances Tracker</code> window.</li>
  <li>Advance towards the target frame by standing close to a nearby NPC to slowly get closer. (Or use DaySkip to advance large distances quickly!)</li>
  <li>Once close enough (Within ~200 frames of the target), run over to the PC.</li>
  <li>From this point, only advance by using menu close prediction, animations and small player movements.</li><br />
  
  <li>Pause the game and reconnect to the generator, search for your target again on the <code>Cram-o-matic</code> window and take note of the target frame.</li>
  <li>Open the <code>Retail Menu Advances Tracker</code> window, enter your target frame into the <code>+</code> field then search. You can now see how many advancements will pass from closing the menu indicated under the <code>Jump</code> column.</li>
  <li>Close and reopen the pause menu until you are close to your target frame, use animation advancements to line up properly with your target.</li>
  <li>If you undershoot the target nudge control stick quickly, once you see your target frame in the <code>Curr. Adv</code> field, interact with the Cram-o-matic by pressing A.</li>
</ul>

Player movement will advance the RNG state 1-2 frames with each new stick input, allowing for more precise advancements during the window of silence, making it much easier to hit a target frame.<br /><br />

If you believe you interacted with the Cram-o-matic on the correct frame, feed it 4 apricorns and take your reward! Make sure the reward matches the output of the generator.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 4/5 -</span> Result Found!<br />
<img src="./images/cram-o-matic/figure-4-result-found-gui-cram.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />
<img src="./images/cram-o-matic/igure-5-result-found-switch-cram.jpg" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

The result matches the output of the generator, mission accomplished! We got 5 Level Balls from the Scam-o... er... Cram-o-matic on our first attempt!<br /><br />

That's all there is to RNG abusing the Cram-o-matic!<br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Time to get to work! </span></h3>
The goal is to interact with the PC in any Pokecenter on the calculated target frame given to us by the <code>Loto-ID</code> tab of the generator. We will be using the advancement methods listed at the top of the page. <u>dayskip</u>, <u>menuing</u> and <u>player movement</u> advances will be used for this example.<br /><br />

If you plan to use the <code>DaySkip</code> feature you should take note of how many frames advance per day skipped to ensure that you don't overshoot your target.<br /><br />

We will be aiming for a Master Ball, this requires the 5 digit number given by the Loto-ID minigame to exactly match the Trainer ID one of your caught/stored Pokemon. We can determine which frame will match our TID using the <code>Loto-ID</code> tab of the generator.<br /><br />

You can search for multiple TIDs by opening <code>Loto-ID.txt</code> in a text editor and inputting a list of TIDs to read from, this file is found in the same directory as the generator.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 1 -</span> Tool setup<br />
<img src="./images/loto-id/figure-1-tool-setup-loto.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Awesome, everything looks good!</span> We can see our current seeds on the <code>Roto-ID</code> tab and have our filters set properly. Time to stand near the PC in Wedgehurst Pokecenter!<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 2 -</span> Game setup<br />
<img src="./images/loto-id/figure-2-game-setup-loto.jpg" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

Once the <code>Loto-ID</code> tab is filled in correctly you can begin looking for target frames by clicking the search button.<br /><br />

<u>If your results are not desirable, repeat the following:</u>
<ol>
  <li>Disconnect your Switch from the tool.</li>
  <li>Restart your game and enter the overworld.</li>
  <li>Enter the pause or Home menu and reconnect your Switch to the tool.</li>
  <li>Search again, do this until you have desirable results.</li>
</ol>
  
<span class="fw-bold">We found a target frame!</span> A Master Ball match on advances 806-808. This is the frame we will press A to fire up the PC. The RNG state will not advance during the menus, you can safely press B if you miss and then begin looking for a new target.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure  3 -</span> Target found!<br />
<img src="./images/loto-id/figure-3-target-found-loto.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />
  
We'll want to exit the pause menu as close to the target frame as possible in order to freeze the noise in the area, then use rapid player movement advances to hit our target frame and finally, interact with the PC on this frame.<br /><br />
  
Here's a more fleshed out example...<br /><br />
<ul>
  <li>The target is 806-808 advances away, delay is 0, and there are 7 NPCs in the building, this information has been entered into the <code>Retail Menu Advances Tracker</code> window.</li>
  <li>Advance towards the target frame by standing close to a nearby NPC to slowly get closer. (Or use DaySkip to advance large distances quickly!)</li>
  <li>Once close enough (Within ~200 frames of the target), run over to the PC.</li>
  <li>From this point, only advance by using menu close prediction, animations and small player movements.</li><br />
  
  <li>Pause the game and reconnect to the generator, search for your target again on the <code>Loto-ID</code> window and take note of the target frame.</li>
  <li>Open the <code>Retail Menu Advances Tracker</code> window, enter your target frame into the <code>+</code> field then search. You can now see how many advancements will pass from closing the menu indicated under the <code>Jump</code> column.</li>
  <li>Close and reopen the pause menu until you are close to your target frame, use animation advancements to line up properly with your target frame.</li>
  <li>If you undershoot the target nudge control stick quickly, once you see your target frame in the <code>Curr. Adv</code> field, interact with the PC by pressing A.</li>
</ul>

Player movement will advance the RNG state 1-2 frames with each new stick input, allowing for more precise advancements during the window of silence, making it much easier to hit a target frame if menu close prediction fails.<br /><br />

If you believe you interacted with the PC on the correct frame, click the <code>Try Loto-ID</code> option in-game and spam through the menus to claim your reward! Make sure the reward matches the output of the generator.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 4/5 -</span> Result Found!<br />
<img src="./images/loto-id/figure-4-result-found-loto.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />
<img src="./images/loto-id/figure-5-result-found-switch-loto.jpg" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

The result matches the output of the generator, mission accomplished!<br /><br />

That's all there is to RNG abusing the the PC lottery function!<br /><br />
