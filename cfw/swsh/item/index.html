This portion of the guide will cover the process of RNG abusing the Cram-o-matic and the PC lottery function in Sword/Shield using the SWSH Overworld RNG Generator by <a href="https://github.com/LegoFigure11LegoFigure11">LegoFigure11</a>. 
Item RNG abuse is best utilized to help players obtain rare/valuable items such as rare Pokeballs!<br /> <br />

<span class="fw-bold">This guide assumes you are using a CFW Switch console running Atmosphere.</span> If you are not running CFW fear not, you can find an alternative CFWless guide here!<br /> <br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Getting Started:</span></h3>
<u>You will need:</u>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/LegoFigure11/swsh-overworld-rng-gui/releases">SWSH Overworld RNG Generator</a> - Latest release</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/Koi-3088/sys-usb-botbase/releases">sys-usb-botbase</a> - Latest release</li> 
  <li><a href="https://github.com/spacemeowx2/ldn_mitm/releases/">ldn-mitm</a> - Latest release</li> 
</ul>

<u>Installation Instructions:</u>
<ol>
  <li>Download and extract all the contents from the <code>SWSH_OWRNG_Generator_GUI.zip</code> into an empty folder.</li>
  <li>Download and extract all the contents from the sys-usb-botbase and ldn-mitm downloads into an empty folder.</a></li>
  <li>Place the <code>atmosphere</code> folder(s) from these downloads onto the root of your Switch SD card and reboot the console.</li>
  <li>Check the <code>/atmosphere/contents</code> directory of your SD card for two folders named <code>430000000000000B</code> & <code>4200000000000010</code>.</li>
  <li>Reboot your Switch console and launch CFW.</li>
</ol>

<u>In-game setup:</u>
<ul>
  <li>Have the Rotom PC lottery function & Cram-o-matic available for use.</li>
  <li>If you plan to RNG abuse the Cram-o-matic, have at least 4 apricorns to use in the machine.</li>
  <li>Stand next to the machine you want to work on.</li>
  <li>Press the Home button on your controller, click <code>Connect</code> on the main window of the tool.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Advancing the RNG state:</span></h3>
<u>Multiple in-game actions can be used to advance the RNG state with varying influence, these include:</u>
<ol>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Player movement -</span> Each time the player stops moving the control stick the RNG state will advance a small amount - Roughly 1-3 advancements & a spammable action.</li><br />
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Rotom Bike -</span> Mounting and dismounting the bike with the <code>+</code> button will advance the RNG state a small amount. - Area specific advancements & a spammable action.</li><br />
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Menu close -</span> Opening and closing the pause menu will advance the RNG state a small amount depending on your location and amount of NPCs present. - Area specific advancements & a spammable action.</li><br />
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Animations -</span> You can make your Pokemon animate on the party summary screen by pressing in the left stick. - 1 advancment per "click" & a spammable action.</li><br />
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Active NPCs -</span> Standing near an NPC will "activate" them, this will advance the RNG state rapidly. - Area specific advancements, good for covering large amounts of advancements quickly.</li><br />
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Map & Flying -</span> We can fly into an area to advance the RNG state too! - Area specific advancements, this is used primarily for hunting Articuno, Zapdos and Moltres.</li><br />
</ol>

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Day Skipping:</span></h3>
We can use the <code>DaySkip</code> feature of the tool to advance the RNG state rapidly, up to a total of around 13,000 advancements per day skipped. The amount of frames that advance by Day Skipping is heavily influenced by the amount of Pokémon currently in your boxes, the number will increase drastically if you store more Pokémon. <u>Does not include Pokémon in eggs</u>.<br /><br /> 

<span class="fw-bold">Closing the pause menu has an added effect of freezing noise in the area for a short time period</span>, we will use this window of silence to our advantage to near guarantee that we interact on the correct frame. (More on this below!)<br /><br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Time to get to work! </span></h3>
The goal is to interact with the Cram-o-matic on the calculated target frame given to us by the <code>Cram-o-matic</code> tab of the generator. We will be using the advancement methods listed at the top of the page. <u>dayskip</u>, <u>menuing</u> and <u>player movement</u> advances will be used for this example.<br /><br />

If you plan to use the <code>DaySkip</code> feature you should take note of how many frames advance per day skipped to ensure that you don't overshoot your target.<br /><br />

In this example we will be aiming for a 5 Level Balls. You can be more specific with the filters if you wish, such as filtering for a specific rare items.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 1 -</span> Tool setup<br />
<img src="./images/cram-o-matic/figure-1-tool-setup-cram.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Awesome, everything looks good!</span> We can see our current seeds on the <code>Cram-o-matic</code> tab and have our filters set properly. Time to stand near the Cram-o-matic!<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 2 -</span> Game setup<br />
<img src="./images/cram-o-matic/figure-2-game-setup-cram.jpg" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

Once the <code>Cram-o-matic</code> tab is filled in correctly you can begin looking for target frames by clicking the search button.<br /><br />

<u>If your results are not desirable, repeat the following:</u>
<ol>
  <li>Disconnect your Switch from the tool.</li>
  <li>Restart your game and enter the overworld.</li>
  <li>Enter the pause or Home menu and reconnect your Switch to the tool.</li>
  <li>Search again, do this until you have desirable results.</li>
</ol>

Calculating the amount of advancements that pass from closing the pause menu is required for this method! Do this roughly 5 times and write down the number of advancements that passed, keep the highest number in mind. (In this example, 35 was the highest number of advancements.)<br /><br />
  
<span class="fw-bold">We found a target frame!</span> 5 Level Balls on advance 795. This is the frame we will press A to initiate the Cram-o-matic. The RNG state will not advance during the menus, you can safely press B if you miss and then begin looking for a new target.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure  3 -</span> Target found!<br />
<img src="./images/cram-o-matic/figure-3-target-found-cram.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />
  
We'll want to exit the pause menu as close to the target frame as possible in order to freeze the noise in the area, then use rapid player movement advances to hit our target frame and finally, interact with the cram-o-matic on this frame.<br /><br />
  
Here's a more fleshed out example...<br /><br />
<ul>
  <li>The target is 795 advances away, delay is 0.</li>
  <li>Advance towards the target frame by standing close to a nearby NPC to slowly get closer. (Or use DaySkip to advance large distances quickly!)</li>
  <li>Once close enough (Within 500 frames of the target), run over to the Cram-o-matic.</li>
  <li>From this point, only advance by opening and closing the menu and using small player movements.</li>
  <li>Earlier we calculated 35 advances from closing the menu slowly advance the RNG state using player movement until roughly 35 frames away to avoid overshooting. (Adapt this number to suit the number you noted down earlier.)</li>
  <li>Pause the game by pressing X, unpause while watching the number in the <code>Curr. Adv</code> field of the generator.</li>
  <li>If you undershoot the target nudge control stick quickly, once you see your target frame in the <code>Curr. Adv</code> field, interact with the Cram-o-matic by pressing A.</li>
</ul>

Player movement will advance the RNG state 1-2 frames with each new stick input, allowing for more precise advancements during the window of silence, making it much easier to hit a target frame.<br /><br />

If you believe you interacted with the Cram-o-matic on the correct frame, feed it 4 apricorns and take your reward! Make sure the reward matches the output of the generator.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 4/5 -</span> Result Found!<br />
<img src="./images/cram-o-matic/figure-4-result-found-gui-cram.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />
<img src="./images/cram-o-matic/igure-5-result-found-switch-cram.jpg" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

The result matches the output of the generator, mission accomplished! We got 5 Level Balls from the Scam-o... er... Cram-o-matic on our first attempt!<br /><br />

That's all there is to RNG abusing the Cram-o-matic!<br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Time to get to work! </span></h3>
The goal is to interact with the PC in any Pokecenter on the calculated target frame given to us by the <code>Loto-ID</code> tab of the generator. We will be using the advancement methods listed at the top of the page. <u>dayskip</u>, <u>menuing</u> and <u>player movement</u> advances will be used for this example.<br /><br />

If you plan to use the <code>DaySkip</code> feature you should take note of how many frames advance per day skipped to ensure that you don't overshoot your target.<br /><br />

We will be aiming for a Master Ball, this requires the 5 digit number given by the Loto-ID minigame to exactly match the Trainer ID one of your caught/stored Pokemon. We can determine which frame will match our TID using the <code>Loto-ID</code> tab of the generator.<br /><br />

You can search for multiple TIDs by opening <code>Loto-ID.txt</code> in a text editor and inputting a list of TIDs to read from, this file is found in the same directory as the generator.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 1 -</span> Tool setup<br />
<img src="./images/loto-id/figure-1-tool-setup-loto.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Awesome, everything looks good!</span> We can see our current seeds on the <code>Roto-ID</code> tab and have our filters set properly. Time to stand near the PC in Wedgehurst Pokecenter!<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 2 -</span> Game setup<br />
<img src="./images/loto-id/figure-2-game-setup-loto.jpg" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

  <li>Disconnect your Switch from the tool.</li>
  <li>Restart your game and enter the overworld.</li>
  <li>Enter the pause or Home menu and reconnect your Switch to the tool.</li>
  <li>Search again, do this until you have desirable results.</li>
</ol>

Calculating the amount of advancements that pass from closing the pause menu is required for this method! Do this roughly 5 times and write down the number of advancements that passed, keep the highest number in mind. (In this example, 12 was the highest number of advancements.)<br /><br />
  
<span class="fw-bold">We found a target frame!</span> A Master Ball match on advances 806-808. This is the frame we will press A to fire up the PC. The RNG state will not advance during the menus, you can safely press B if you miss and then begin looking for a new target.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure  3 -</span> Target found!<br />
<img src="./images/loto-id/figure-3-target-found-loto.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />
  
We'll want to exit the pause menu as close to the target frame as possible in order to freeze the noise in the area, then use rapid player movement advances to hit our target frame and finally, interact with the PC on this frame.<br /><br />
  
Here's a more fleshed out example...<br /><br />
<ul>
  <li>The target is 806-808 advances away, delay is 0.</li>
  <li>Advance towards the target frame by standing close to a nearby NPC to slowly get closer. (Or use DaySkip to advance large distances quickly!)</li>
  <li>Once close enough (Within 500 frames of the target), run over to the PC.</li>
  <li>From this point, only advance by opening and closing the menu and using small player movements.</li>
  <li>Earlier we calculated 12 advances from closing the menu slowly advance the RNG state using player movement until roughly 12 frames away to avoid overshooting. (Adapt this number to suit the number you noted down earlier.)</li>
  <li>Pause the game by pressing X, unpause while watching the number in the <code>Curr. Adv</code> field of the generator.</li>
  <li>If you undershoot the target nudge control stick quickly, once you see your target frame in the <code>Curr. Adv</code> field, interact with the PC by pressing A.</li>
</ul>

Player movement will advance the RNG state 1-2 frames with each new stick input, allowing for more precise advancements during the window of silence, making it much easier to hit a target frame.<br /><br />

If you believe you interacted with the PC on the correct frame, click the <code>Try Loto-ID</code> option in-game and spam through the menus to claim your reward! Make sure the reward matches the output of the generator.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 4/5 -</span> Result Found!<br />

The result matches the output of the generator, mission accomplished!<br /><br />

That's all there is to RNG abusing the the PC lottery function!<br /><br />
