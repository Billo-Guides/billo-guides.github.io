</div><hr />

<p>SWSH_OWRNG_Generator_GUI can be used to track the current RNG state, and the amount of advancements that have passed since connecting to the program. Frames will advance naturally depending on your location and the amount of NPCs that are present. Since both machines are located in-doors, these are the only variables that we need to consider.</p>
  
<p>Different in-game actions can also be used to advance the RNG state with varying influence, the most useful actions can be found in the table directly below.</p>

  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>The <code class="fw-bold">Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> window can be used to predict the amount of advancements that will pass from closing the pause menu. Closing the pause menu also has an added effect of freezing the RNG state in the area for a a few seconds, this makes it a great option for closing in on any target frames as it provides a lot more consistency in doing so.</p>

    <p><span class="fw-bold">NPC Counts are likely as follows:</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Wedgehurst Pokemon Center (Loto) = 5 NPCs</li>
      <li>Isle of Armor Dojo (Cram-o-Matic)= 21 NPCs with completed story</li>
      <li>Snowslide Slope (Watt Trader)= 1-2 NPCs, requires calibration</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By knowing how many advancements will occur from closing the pause menu, and having a window of silence to interact with the machine, we can near guarantee to hit any potential target frames.</p>

    <p>When using the <code class="fw-bold">Consider menu close</code> feature of the <code class="fw-bold">Menu Close Advances Viewer</code>, the result output will be for the frame you should close the pause menu on, not the frame of which you should interact with the machine!</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Press the <code class="fw-bold">X</code> button on your controller to open the pause menu, then disconnect and reconnect to the main window. This will ensure the number inside the <code class="fw-bold">Curr. Adv</code> remains at 0.</li>
        <li>Click the <code class="fw-bold">Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> button at the top of the main window to open a smaller window. Your seeds should be visible in the correct fields.</li>
        <li>Close the pause menu then quickly re-open it, take note of the number of advancements that have occurred from doing so.</li>
        <li>Enter your number of advancements into the <code class="fw-bold">Init Adv.</code> field. If the above steps were closely followed, this number should be 0.</li>
        <li>Type 0 into the <code class="fw-bold">NPCs</code> field and search. Gradually increase this number by 1 until you find a match. Repeat this step a few times to ensure the advancement predictions are accurate.</li>

<p><span class="fw-bold">That's all there is to RNG abusing the PC lottery function!</span></p>

<p>The goal is to interact with the Watt Trader in Snowslide Slope on the calculated target frame given to us by the <code class="fw-bold">Watt Trader</code> window of the generator, we will be using the advancement methods listed in the table above to hit the target frame, most notably, animation advancements and date skipping.</p>

<p>In this example we will be aiming for a Dream Ball or Beast Ball, as these are the most valuable items that this trader has to offer.</p>

    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Required Setup:</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Before starting, you will need to properly set your game up in the correct state, this will make the RNG abuse process much simpler if done properly.</p>

    <p>When moving close to an NPC, typically advancements will begin to occur at an uncontrollably fast rate (roughly 2500 per minute), to avoid this, you will need to quickly interact with the Watt Trader before he has time to react. This can be done as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Fly into Snowslide Slope, or move far enough away from the NPC so that he is no longer looking at the player.</li><p></p>
      <li>Mount your bike, then clickly ride towards the NPC and hit the A button, if done correctly you will have interacted with the NPC before he has time to react.</li><p></p>
      <li>Back out of the text box dialogue, then connect to the generator if you have not already done so, confirm that the advancements are slow.</li><p></p>
      <li>Once confirmed, use the <a href="#automating-date-skipping-cfw">above mentioned method</a> to date skip a single day, then save the game. The slow advancements will now persist upon resetting the game.</li><p></p>
      <li>You should now be properly set up, the NPC is not "activated", and date skipping will have reset time based events (including the Watt Trader!).</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>Resetting time based events before saving is important, as speaking to the NPC for the first time in a day determines which items they will have in future. The first 2 days worth of items are pre-determined, and the third day can be RNG manipulated using this method.</blockquote>

<p>Observing the above image, we can see that interacting with the Watt Trader using the above method does not cause the RNG state to rapidly advance (see the <code class="fw-bold">Curr Adv.</code> field on the bottom-left), but if we do not interact with the NPC quick enough...</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 2 -</span> Fast Advancement Example<br />
<a href="./images/watt-trader/fast-advancement-example.gif" target="_blank"><img src="./images/watt-trader/fast-advancement-example.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"></a><br /><br />

<p>We can now see advancements are occuring at an almost uncontrollable rate. This is why correct setup is important as it makes the process of hitting a desirable result significantly easier.</p>

<p>Once you are certain your in-game setup is correct, you can begin searching setting up SWSH_OWRNG_Generator_GUI.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold">Awesome, everything looks good!</span> We can see our current seeds on the <code class="fw-bold">Watt Trader</code> tab and have our filters set properly to look for Dream Ball/Beast Ball. Time to stand begin searching for target frames!</p>

      <li>Press the <code class="fw-bold">X</code> button to pause the game.</li>
      <li>Open the <code class="fw-bold">Watt Trader</code> tab, then set the filters & NPC count.</li>
      <li>Search for a desirable target frame.</li>

    <p><span class="fw-bold">If your results are not desirable, repeat the following:</p>

        <li>Disconnect your Switch from the tool.</li>
        <li>Restart your game and enter the overworld.</li>
        <li>Pause the game, then reconnect your Switch to the tool.</li>
        <li>Search again, do this until you have desirable results.</li>
      </ol>

      <blockquote>You will need around roughly ~40,000 PokeWatts per ball, be sure to stock up on enough watts before attempting to hit target frames.</blockquote>

<p><span class="fw-bold">We found a target frame!</span> A Beast Ball on advance 205. This will be the that we aim to interact with the Watt Trader on.</p>

<hr /><div class="title" style="background-color: #0c0038;">
  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Advancing Towards The Target</h1>
</div><hr />

<p>The <code class="fw-bold">Watt Trader</code> window of SWSH_OWRNG_Generator_GUI displays the target on frame 205, we do not need to account for any delay. This means we will aim to interact with the Watt Trader on frame 205.</p>

<p>Using the <a href="#menu-close-overview-cfw">above mentioned method</a>, we calculated that there are 2 NPCs in the area. This number is variable upon resetting the game (typically 1-2), be sure to calibrate your NPC count on every attempt to avoid missing your target frame.</p>

<div class="card border-dark">
  <div class="anchored card-header" style="background-color: #0c0038;" id="advancing-to-target-watt-trader-cfw">
    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Hitting Your Target Frame:</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">

    <ul>
      <li>Advance towards your target frame using <code class="fw-bold">date skipping</code> (large distances) or <code class="fw-bold">menu close</code> + <code class="fw-bold">animations</code> (small distances)</a></li><p></p>
      <li>When you are a few hundred frames away from your target, pause the game using the <code class="fw-bold">X</code> button, then disconnect and reconnect to the main window, then search for your target again in the <code class="fw-bold">Watt Trader</code> window.</li><p></p>
      <li>Take note of the target frame displayed in the table, do not factor in NPCs or consider menu close at this stage, this number may be needed later.</li>
    </ul>

      <blockquote>From this point it's recommended to only use <code class="fw-bold">menu close</code> & <code class="fw-bold">amimation</code> advancements as they advance in small increments, making them easy to keep track of.</blockquote>

      <ul>
        <li>Click the <code class="fw-bold">consider menu close</code> checkbox, then enter the number of NPCs inside the <code class="fw-bold">NPCs</code> field. This number should have been calibrated earlier, but if you did not do this, do it now.</li><p></p>
        <li>Search for your target again, if you see your target frame in the search results this will be the frame you will aim to close the pause menu on, then interact with the Watt Trader NPC quickly to hit your target frame.</li><p></p>
        <li>If you do NOT see your target frame, open the <code class="fw-bold">Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> and enter the target frame from step 3 into the <code class="fw-bold">+</code> field, then enter your NPC count and hit search.</li><p></p>
        <li>Now take note of the closest frame you can get to using menu close prediction, this will now be the frame you aim to get to, you can use movement advancements to hit your target frame after closing the pause menu instead.</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>Movement advancements typically advance the RNG state by 1 or 2 each time, which means we can use this in the event that we cannot hit our target frame using menu close prediction by itself, simply close the pause menu and quickly nudge the control stick enough times to reach the target frame instead.</blockquote>

      <ul>
        <li>Open and close the pause menu until closing the menu a single time lands onto your target frame, according to the <code class="fw-bold">Watt Trader</code> window prediction. Pay attention to the <code class="fw-bold">Curr. Adv</code> field of the main window to avoid overshooting your target.</li><p></p>
        <li>Close the pause menu, this should have landed you on (or close to) your target frame. If you did not land on your target frame use movement advancements at this point until you reach your target, then quickly interact with the Watt Trader NPC.</li><p></p>
        <li>You can now back out of any dialogue and stand back in the overworld, you may have noticed that advancements occured once you speak to the NPC, these can be ignored. It is only important to interact with the NPC on the correct frame.</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote><p>As mentioned above, your item will be available on the third day, which means you will need to date skip twice in order to have the item available for purchase</p> 
        Interact with NPC on correct target frame -> date skip -> interact with NPC -> date skip -> interact with NPC -> click todays highlight -> Purchase item for ~40k PokeWatts</blockquote>

        <p>You can also interact with the NPC on each day skipped on a frame that produces a Dream Ball or Beast Ball to "chain" results as a time save once you are certain you have hit a desirable target frame.</p>

<p>In the above image we can see that the game was unpaused on frame 197, and menu close prediction brought the current advancement to frame 203, then a single movement advancement brought the current advancement to 205, which is the target frame. Then we quickly interacted with the Watt Trader to lock in our desired item.</p>
