<p>This guide will cover the process of RNG abusing item machines (Cram-o-Matic, Rotom Lottery) and NPCs (Watt Trader) in Sword/Shield, using the SWSH Overworld RNG Generator by <a href="https://github.com/LegoFigure11">LegoFigure11</a>. Item RNG abuse is best utilized to help players obtain rare/valuable items such as rare Pokeballs.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #b60606;">From here this guide assumes you are using a CFW Switch console running Atmosphere.</span></p>

       <li>Close the pause menu, if you hit your target, quickly interact with the machine to grab your reward. Do movement advancements if you need to before interacting with the machine if you are behind your target frame.</li><p></p>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>Remember, the goal is to interact with the machine on the correct frame, as long as you hit your target seed and stayed within the dialogue without backing out, you will achieve your desired result.</blockquote>

<p>The result matches the output given by the <code class="fw-bold">Loto-ID</code> sub window, mission accomplished! We got a Master Ball from the lottery on the first attempt!</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold">That's all there is to RNG abusing the Rotom lottery minigame!</span></p>

</div><hr />

<p>The goal is to interact with the Watt Trader in Snowslide Slope on the calculated target frame given to us by the <code class="fw-bold">Watt Trader</code> window of the generator, we will be using the advancement methods listed in the table above to hit the target frame, most notably, animation advancements and date skipping.</p>

<p>In this example we will be aiming for a Dream Ball or Beast Ball, as these are the most valuable items that this trader has to offer.</p>

    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Required Setup:</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Before starting, you will need to properly set your game up in the correct state, this will make the RNG abuse process much simpler if done properly.</p>

    <p>You will need roughly 40,000 Watts to buy the rare items from the Watt Trader, stock up on enough watts before doing anything else.</p>
                                                                                                                                                            
    <p>When moving close to an NPC, typically advancements will begin to occur at an uncontrollably fast rate (roughly 2500 per minute), to avoid this, you will need to quickly interact with the Watt Trader before he has time to react. This can be done as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Fly into Snowslide Slope, or move far enough away from the NPC so that he is no longer looking at the player.</li><p></p>
      <li>Mount your bike, then clickly ride towards the NPC and hit the A button, if done correctly you will have interacted with the NPC before he has time to react.</li><p></p>
      <li>Back out of the text box dialogue, then connect to the generator if you have not already done so, confirm that the advancements are slow.</li><p></p>
      <li>Once confirmed, use the <a href="#automating-date-skipping-cfw">above mentioned method</a> to date skip a single day, then save the game. The slow advancements will now persist upon resetting the game.</li><p></p>
      <li>You should now be properly set up, the NPC is not "activated", and date skipping will have reset time based events (including the Watt Trader!).</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>Resetting time based events before saving is important, as speaking to the NPC for the first time in a day determines which items they will have in future. The first 2 days worth of items are pre-determined, and the third day can be RNG manipulated using this method.</blockquote>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 1 -</span> Slow Advancement Example<p></p>
<a href="./images/watt-trader/slow-advancement-example.gif" target="_blank"><img src="./images/watt-trader/slow-advancement-example.gif" class="img-fluid"></a><br /><br />

<p>Observing the above image, we can see that interacting with the Watt Trader using the above method does not cause the RNG state to rapidly advance (see the <code class="fw-bold">Curr Adv.</code> field on the bottom-left), but if we do not interact with the NPC quick enough...</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 2 -</span> Fast Advancement Example<p></p>
<a href="./images/watt-trader/fast-advancement-example.gif" target="_blank"><img src="./images/watt-trader/fast-advancement-example.gif" class="img-fluid"></a><br /><br />

<p>We can now see advancements are occuring at an almost uncontrollable rate. This is why correct setup is important as it makes the process of hitting a desirable result significantly easier.</p>

<p>Once you are certain your in-game setup is correct, you can begin searching setting up SWSH_OWRNG_Generator_GUI.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold">Awesome, everything looks good!</span> We can see our current seeds on the <code class="fw-bold">Watt Trader</code> tab and have our filters set properly to look for Dream Ball/Beast Ball. Time to stand begin searching for target frames!</p>

      <li>Connect to SWSH_OWRNG_Generator_GUI at this point, then open the <code class="fw-bold">Watt Trader</code> tab.</li>
      <li>Set your search filters, then click the <code class="fw-bold">Search</code> button and check for desirable target frames.</li>

<p><span class="fw-bold">We found a target frame!</span> A Beast Ball on advance 205. This will be the that we aim to interact with the Watt Trader on.</p>

</div><hr />

<p>Using the <a href="#menu-close-overview-cfw">above mentioned method</a>, we calculated that there are 2 NPCs in the area. This number is variable upon resetting the game (typically 1-2), be sure to calibrate your NPC count on every attempt to avoid missing your target frame.</p>

    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Hitting Your Target Frame:</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">

    <ul>
      <li>Advance towards your target frame using <code class="fw-bold">date skipping</code> (large distances) or <code class="fw-bold">menu close</code> + <code class="fw-bold">animations</code> (small distances)</a></li><p></p>
      <li>When you are a few hundred frames away from your target, pause the game using the <code class="fw-bold">X</code> button, then disconnect and reconnect to the main window, then search for your target again in the <code class="fw-bold">Watt Trader</code> window.</li><p></p>
      <li>Take note of the target frame displayed in the table, do not factor in NPCs or consider menu close at this stage, this number may be needed later.</li>
    </ul>

      <blockquote>From this point it's recommended to only use <code class="fw-bold">menu close</code> & <code class="fw-bold">amimation</code> advancements as they advance in small increments, making them easy to keep track of.</blockquote>

      <ul>
        <li>Click the <code class="fw-bold">consider menu close</code> checkbox, then enter the number of NPCs inside the <code class="fw-bold">NPCs</code> field. This number should have been calibrated earlier, but if you did not do this, do it now.</li><p></p>
        <li>Search for your target again, if you see your target frame in the search results this will be the frame you will aim to close the pause menu on, then interact with the Watt Trader NPC quickly to hit your target frame.</li><p></p>
        <li>If you do NOT see your target frame, open the <code class="fw-bold">Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> and enter the target frame from step 3 into the <code class="fw-bold">+</code> field, then enter your NPC count and hit search.</li><p></p>
        <li>Now take note of the closest frame you can get to using menu close prediction, this will now be the frame you aim to get to, you can use movement advancements to hit your target frame after closing the pause menu instead.</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>Movement advancements typically advance the RNG state by 1 or 2 each time, which means we can use this in the event that we cannot hit our target frame using menu close prediction by itself, simply close the pause menu and quickly nudge the control stick enough times to reach the target frame instead.</blockquote>

      <ul>
        <li>Open and close the pause menu until closing the menu a single time lands onto your target frame. Pay attention to the <code class="fw-bold">Curr. Adv</code> field of the main window to avoid overshooting your target.</li><p></p>
        <li>Close the pause menu, this should have landed you on (or close to) your target frame. If you did not land on your target frame use movement advancements at this point until you reach your target, then quickly interact with the Watt Trader NPC.</li><p></p>
        <li>You can now back out of any dialogue and stand back in the overworld, you may have noticed that advancements occured once you speak to the NPC, these can be ignored. It is only important to interact with the NPC on the correct frame.</li>
      </ul>

       <blockquote><p>As mentioned above, your item will be available on the third day, which means you will need to date skip twice in order to have the item available for purchase</p> 
        Interact with NPC on correct target frame -> date skip -> interact with NPC -> date skip -> interact with NPC -> click todays highlight -> Purchase item for ~40k PokeWatts</blockquote>

        <p>You can also interact with the NPC on each day skipped on a frame that produces a Dream Ball or Beast Ball to "chain" results as a time save once you are certain you have hit a desirable target frame.</p>

<p>In the above image we can see that the game was unpaused on frame 197, and menu close prediction brought the current advancement to frame 203, then a single movement advancement brought the current advancement to 205, which is the target frame. Then we quickly interacted with the Watt Trader to lock in our desired item.</p>
