</div><hr />

<p>This section provides a worked example of how to do Wishing Piece RNG manipulation for Max Raid battles. Wishing Piece RNG involves throwing a Wishing Piece into your chosen Raid Den, searching for a desirable result using PokeFinder, then advancing seed by date skipping using Luxray until the result has been acquired.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #b60606;">From here it is assumed that you have followed all of the setup instruction found on the main page, and have a general understanding of how to use each of the necessary tools.</span></p>

    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Den Finding & Search Filters</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Before anything else, you will need to pick the Den or Pokemon you wish to RNG abuse in. This is best achieved using an online resource, such as the <a href="https://www.serebii.net/swordshield/maxraidbattledens.shtml">Serebii.net Raid Encounter Tables</a></p>

    <p>Navigate to the location of your desired Raid Den in game, defeat the raid if there is a Pokemon inside, then throw in a Wishing Piece, this will save the game. You will now need to match the in-game den with the corrisponding Den ID in PokeFinder. An example of how to do this can be seen in the above image.</p>

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Finding the Den ID:</span></h6>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the <code span class="fw-bold">Den Map</code> found in the <code span class="fw-bold">Gen 8 Tools</code> dropdown menu of PokeFinder.</li>
      <li>Select the map that corrisponds to the map which contains your desired Pokemon (Wild Area | IoA | CT).</li>
      <li>Select different Den IDs until you find one in the rough location of where you are standing in-game.</li>
      <li>Select the Den ID in the PokeFinder main window and confirm the species match on PokeFinder and in-game.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Now you will need to obtain the correct type of raid, if your Pokemon only appears in a Rare (purple neam) raid, you will need to reset the den until a Rare raid appears from throwing in a Wishing Piece. This can be done one of two ways:

    <ul>
      <li>Run back and fourth between raids, throwing in Wishing Pieces until your raid is of the desired rarity.</li>
      <li>Throw a Wishing Piece into your desired den, then press the Home button once the beam appears. If it is not your desired rarity, restart the game.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Event Distributions are also red, so you will need to use the first method if you are hunting for an event distribution den.</p>

    <blockquote>If your den is from a promotional event distribution, select <code span class="fw-bold">Event</code> in the <code span class="fw-bold">Location</code> dropdown menu on the left, then select the exact distribution in the dropdown directly below. You do not need to track your Raid Den location for event distributions.</blockquote>

    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Finding Your Current Seed</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>After finding your Den ID using the above mentioned method, you can begin searching for your current seed. This can be done using either PKHeX or Capturesight, depending on which tools you initially set up on the main page.</p>

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Using PKHeX/LiveHeX:</span></h6>
    <ol>
      <li>Open PKHeX, then connect open the LiveHeX sub window and enter the IP of your Switch console, then click <code span class="fw-bold">Connect</code>.</li>
      <li>Once connected, open the dropdown menu and select one of the Raid options, depending on the map location your desired raid is in.</li>
      <li>Select your Den ID in the dropdown menu, this should match the Den ID displayed by PokeFinder. The raid information will appear on screen.</li>
      <li>Confirm that the Den on PKHeX has <code span class="fw-bold">isWishingPiece</code> set to true, then copy the seed and paste into the <code span class="fw-bold">Seed</code> field of PokeFinder.</li>
    </ol>

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Using CaptureSight:</span></h6>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the Tesla Menu, then open the CaptureSight overlay and navigate to the <code span class="fw-bold">Raid</code> section.</li>
      <li>Click on the <code span class="fw-bold">Active Raid</code> button that corresponds to the map location of your desired raid.</li>
      <li>Select the raid that matches the Den ID given by PokeFinder, you should now see a seed has been produced.</li>
      <li>Manually type the seed given by CaptureSight into the <code span class="fw-bold">Seed</code> field of PokeFinder.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>After finding the correct den type (common, rare, event), and checking the current seed you can begin searching for potential results.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Use one of the methods listed above to find your current seed, then set your Search filters in PokeFinder to match what you are looking for. In the above example we will be searching for any Shiny x, which can be found in common raids with 5* Rarity.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Paste or type your seed into the <code span class="fw-bold">Seed</code> field of PokeFinder.</li>
      <li>In the central portion, select the raid ratity and desired species to hunt.</li>
      <li>Set your search filters on the right, such as filtering any shiny raid.</li>
      <li>Click <code span class="fw-bold">Search</code>, if no results are found or the result is not desirable, repeat the seed checking process mentioned above.</li>
    </ol>

    <blockquote>It may take a number of seed checks to find a result, depending on your search filters and amount of frames to search through. Consider being less specific with search filters where possible, or increase the search range for a better chance of finding results.</blockquote>

  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Advancing Towards A Target</h1>
</div><hr />

<p>This section covers how to advance towards a target frame, and how to manipulate the species to match your desired Pokemon.</p>

<div class="card border-dark">
  <div class="anchored card-header" style="background-color: #0c0038;" id="frame-advancement-retail">
    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Advancing Towards The Target</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p><span class="fw-bold">Target frame found!</span> in Figure 4 we can see that a Shiny, x natured y has been found in z advancements, and that the den we are searching in has a common (RED) beam. It is now time to begin advancing towards the target.</p>

    <p>Frames are advanced by 1 per day that has passed, which means we will need to advance x days to hit our target shiny frame. We can trick the game into thinking a day has passed using the date skipping exploit.</p>

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">How to date skip:</span></h6>
    <p>Date-skipping using CFW can be automated using Luxray, which can be opened from the Tesla Menu. Date skipping any other way is a lengthy, manual process.</p>

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Using Luxray (Recommended):</span></h6>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the Tesla Menu, then open Luxray, a calculator will appear.</li>
      <li>Type the number of advancements you wish to do into the calculator.</li>
      <li>Stand inside an in-door location in game, then press the <code span class="fw-bold">Step</code> button.</li>
      <li>Wait for the calculator to count down to 0, then head to your Raid Den (~7000 advances per hour).</li>
    </ol>

    <details>
      <summary><span class="fw-bold">Manual Methods</span></summary>

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Fast Method:</span></h6>
    <ol>
      <li>Enter an online single or double battle, you can search without a code for quicker wait times.</li>
      <li>Enter airplane mode once you enter the battle. Alternatively you can play out the whole battle if you wish.</li>
      <li>From here navigate to the System Settings and change the date ahead by one day, then re-open the game.</li>
      <li>If done correctly your raid should now give off Watts again, as if you have not interacted with it in the first place.</li>
      <li>From here you can date-skip easily by repeating step 3. This exploit needs to be re-activated every time the game is reset.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If your target is >1000 advancements away and you intend to use the fast method, it is recommended to re-locate to an indoor location to do your advancements to avoid crashing the game.</p>
    
      <h6><span class="fw-bold">Slow Method:</span></h6>
      <ol>
        <li>Find an active Max Raid, interact with it, then click "Invite Others".</li>
        <li>From here navigate to the System Settings and change the date ahead by one day.</li>
        <li>Exit back to the main menu of the home screen and reopen the game.</li>
        <li>If done correctly your raid should now give off Watts again, as if you have not interacted with it in the first place.</li>  
        <li>To repeat this process you will need to start again from step 1.</li>
      </ol>
    </details>

    <blockquote><span class="fw-bold">Note -</span> If you wish to manipulate the species inside the den you must save 3 advancements (or date skips) away from your target! The first 2 days are locked onto a specific species and the third one is decided at random.</blockquote>

    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Species Manipulation (The "3 Day" Method)</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>At this stage you should be exactly 3 frames/advances/days away from your target (today(0), second day(1), third day(2), target day(3)), from here you can manipulate the species on the "target day".</p>

    <p>In the above image, we saved 3 frames away from the target and advanced the seed 3 times, but the species is incorrect, this problem can be corrected by doing the following:</p>

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Species Manipulation Tutorial:</span></h6>
    <ol>
      <li>First, save the game once you are confident that you are 3 frames away from your target den.</li>
      <li>Advance 3 days, then enter the raid to confirm that it is what you expect (check if shiny, capture if specific stats and non shiny).</li>
      <li>Reset the game and re-enter the overworld, you should now be stood back at your raid den, 3 advanced away from the target.</li>
      <li>Advance 3 days, you should now see that the species has changed, repeat this step until your desired species appears.</li>
      <li>Save once you hit your desired species if you wish to share the raid with others!</li>
    </ol>

    <blockquote>If you're unsure whether you've hit the correct frame or species, especially when targeting a shiny Pokémon, you can enter the raid and intentionally lose. This allows you to verify that the Pokémon matches your expectations before saving the game.</blockquote>

<a href="raid/images/figure-6-result-found.gif" target="_blank"><img src="raid/images/figure-6-result-found.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"></a><br /><br />

<p>The den now contains the desired species, in this case, a 5 star Bewear species! We can now capture the Pokemon or share the raid with friends.</p>

<p>When sharing the raid with friends, ensure the System Time does not pass 00:00 (Midnight) as this will cause the seed to advance naturally. Since you should be saved on a raid, you can simply change the date back to the date you saved on to preserve the current seed and share the raid across multiple days.</p>
