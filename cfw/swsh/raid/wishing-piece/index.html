    A worked example of RNG manipulating Max Raid dens using Wishing Pieces.
</small>
<hr />

<p>This section provides a worked example of how to do Wishing Piece RNG manipulation for Max Raid battles. Wishing Piece RNG involves throwing a Wishing Piece into your chosen Raid Den, searching for a desirable result using PokeFinder, then advancing seed by date skipping until the result has been acquired.</p>

    <span class="fw-bold">Important -</span> From here it is assumed that you have followed all of the setup instruction found on the main page. We also assume that you have a general understanding finding your Den ID/seed, and of how to use each of the necessary tools.

    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>Before doing anything else you will need to pick a the Raid Den or Pokemon that you wish to RNG abuse. Instructions on how to find your Den ID can be found on the main page. If you do not know how to find this information you must go back and review the material starting from <a href="http://billo-guides.github.io/cfw/swsh/raid#pokefinder-den-map" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this point</a>. Return to this page once you have picked a desirable Raid Den and found the Den ID.</p>

        <p>Next, you will need to aquire a den of the correct rarity. This is done by saving outside of an inactive den then using either of the following methods:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Throw a Wishing Piece into the Raid Den and press the <code class="fw-bold">Home</code> button on your controller once you see the beam colour. If the colour does not match your desired rarity, reset the game before saving and retry.</li>
            <li>Throw a Wishing Piece into the Raid Den and let the game save, if the colour does not match your desired rarity, clear the den or throw a Wishing Piece into a different den and retry. This method consumes more Wishing Pieces.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><span class="fw-bold">Note - </span>Event Distribution dens will always be of common rarity (red beam) which means you will need to use the second method and check the species inside the den to confirm that you have spawned an Event Distribution den.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>After aquiring the correct Raid Den rarity you will need to configure PokeFinder accordingly. In this example our search filters are configured to search for any shiny Runerigus within 10,000 advances. It takes roughly 1 hour to advance 7,000 days using the quickest method (Luxray date advancing). Keep this in mind when considering your search range.</p>

        <p>Once you have configured your search filters, connect to LiveHeX and open the Raid subwindow at the bottom, then navigate through the dropdown list until you find your Den ID. In this example my Den ID is 72.</p>

        <p>Copy the seed and paste it into the <code class="fw-bold">Seed</code> field of PokeFinder and hit the <code class="fw-bold">Search</code> button. If your seed produces any Pokemon that matches your search conditions the search result table will be populated.</p>

        <p>If you did not find any desirable result, consider setting less strict search filters, increasing your search range, or finding a different seed by clearing out the den and throwing in a new Wishing Piece.</p>

<div class="card border-dark">
    <div class="anchored card-header" style="background-color: #0c0038;" id="frame-advancement-raid-cfw">
        <span class="fw-bold text-light">Advancing Towards a Target</span>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>In Figure 4 we can see that a Shiny, Gentle natured Runerigus has been found in 1896 advances (rare beam). It is now time to begin advancing the seed using date skipping until we are close to the target.</p>

        <p>The seed is advanced 1-by-1 per day that has passed, which means we will need to advance 1896 days to hit our target seed. We can trick the game into thinking a day has passed using the Luxray date advancement tool (recommended for speed), or using the date skipping exploit (recommended if you dislike the idea of using Luxray to artificially modify the system date).</p>

        <p><span class="fw-bold">Note -</span> Most players will want to manipulate the species, this is done by 3 advances before your target seed. Ensure that you subtract 3 from the total amount of advances required if you plan to manipulate species. So in my case, I would advance 1893 days as I wish for my shiny raid to be a Runerigus.</p>

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">Date Skipping Methods</span></h6>
        <p>These are all of the possible methods used to advance the RNG state, from quickest to slowest:</p>

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">Using Luxray (Quickest, automated method)</span></h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Launch Luxray through the Homebrew Menu.</li>
            <li>Type the amount of days you wish to advance into the calculator.</li>
            <li>Click the <code class="fw-bold">Step</code> button and wait for the calculator to count to 0.</li>
        </ol>

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">PvP Date Skipping Exploit (Quickest, manual method)</span></h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the game and enter any Wild Area. Position your camera so you can see some active raid beams or claim the Watts from a nearby raid den.</li>
            <li>Open the Y-Comm, connect to the internet, and select the <code span class="fw-bold">Link Battle</code> option.</li>
            <li>Search for a battle with no code to find an online battle as quickly as possible.</li>
            <li>Once you have entered the battle, cancel the battle by turning on <code span class="fw-bold">Airplane Mode</code>.</li>
            <li>Close any in-game menus and go back to the overworld.</li>
            <li>Change the console date forward in the <code span class="fw-bold">System Settings</code> > <code span class="fw-bold">System</code>, then resume the game where you are looking at the overworld.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>It is possible to skip multiple days at once without resuming the game. To do this, setting the date forward, hit <code span class="fw-bold">OK</code>, and repeat this process until you have done enough days. You can only skip once each time you hit <code span class="fw-bold">OK</code>, so changing the date forward by more than 1 will still be treated as 1.</li>
                <li>If you are in the Wild Area, resuming the game after advancing multiple days has a chance to crash your game! If you are advancing more than 1 month at a time, we suggest you move indoors to a Pok&eacute;mon Center.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>If you did this correctly, the screen will flash, the currently active raid beams will change location, and any Watts you claimed will become available again.</li>
            <li>Navigate to an indoor location when skipping >1000 days to avoid crashing the game.</li>
            <li>Repeat this process from step 4. The exploit remains active until the game is restarted.</li>
        </ol>

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">"Invite Others" Date Skipping Exploit (Slow, manual method)</span></h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the game, enter any Wild Area and find an inactive raid den.</li>
            <li>Throw a Wishing Piece into the raid den, then interact with it.</li>
            <li>Click <code span class="fw-bold">Invite Others</code>, then minimize the game by pressing the Home button.</li>
            <li>Navigate to <code span class="fw-bold">System Settings</code>. Change the console date forward under <code span class="fw-bold">System</code>, then resume the game.</li>
            <li>Back out of the raid and re-enter the overworld.</li>
            <li>If you did this correctly, you should see that you are able to claim Watts from the raid den again.</li>
            <li>Repeat this process from Step 3 onwards as much as needed.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>For targets >1000 advances away, navigate to an in-door locaion, like a PokeCenter before date skipping. Skipping long distances inside the Wild Areas can cause the game to crash due to the constantly changing Max Raids.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>Due to the behaviour of raid dens a technique known as the "3 day method" is used to control the species. The first 2 advances will have the species locked in place, while the third advance (or third day) will be able to be manipulated using the method below.</p>

        <p>At this stage you should be exactly 3 advances/days away from your target (today(0), second day(1), third day(2), target day(3)). From here you can manipulate the species on the "target day".</p>

        <p>In the above image, the game has been saved and we are 3 advances away from the target. After advancing the seed 3 times we entered the raid to confirm that the Pokemon is shiny, but the species is wrong. This problem can be resolved by doing the following:</p>

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">Species Manipulation Tutorial</span></h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Check your seed and confirm that you are exactly 3 advances away from the target.</li>
            <li>Save the game once you are confident that you are in the correct state.</li>
            <li>Advance the seed 3 times using date skipping and interact with the den. If the species is not what you wanted reset the game.</li>
            <li>You should now be stood outside your den 3 advances away, repeat step 3 until your desired species appears.</li>
            <li>(Optional) Save the game after acquiring your desired species if you intend to share it with friends.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Take note of the date the game was saved on. When a new day passes (according to System Time) the seed will advance which will cause you to lose your current den.</p>
