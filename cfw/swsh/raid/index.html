<h5 span class="fw-bold">Introduction</h5>
<p>Sword/Shield Max Raid RNG manipulation is used to select for specific characteristics of Pok&eacute;mon found in raid battles. It is possible to predict values such as IVs, Nature, Shiny status, Size (Jumbo/Teensy Mark in SV), and Gender. The Pok&eacute;mon species and raid star count cannot be manipulated, but we can randomly reroll them until the desired target is achieved.</p>

<p>Note that it is only possible to manipulate encounters found inside Max Raid dens; it is NOT POSSIBLE to manipulate the details of Pok&eacute;mon found in Dynamax Adventures.</p>

<p>Each raid has a randomly-assigned "raid seed" that determines the traits of the Pok&eacute;mon inside a den. Every day that passes advances the den seed by 1 in a predictable manner, making RNG abuse entirely possible via "date skipping". We can simply skip the required number of days to reach a desired seed.</p>

    <span class="fw-bold">Important -</span> Remove all mods and cheats for SwSh before proceeding. Mods/cheats can alter the RNG of the games and cause RAM reads to fail.

    <p></p>
    <p>Switch mods/cheats are stored in the <code span class="fw-bold">atmosphere/contents</code> directory on your SD card. This folder is typically empty on a fresh installation of Atmosph&egrave;re.</p>

    <details>
        <summary><span class="fw-bold">Methods for Disabling Mods/Cheats</span></summary>
        <p>Any of these methods can work to disable mods/cheats. You should select the best one for your use case.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Rename the <code span class="fw-bold">atmosphere/contents</code> folder to something else, such as <code span class="fw-bold">oldcontents</code>. This will allow you to keep everything you previously installed. You can simply rename the folder back when done.</li>
            <li>Delete the <code span class="fw-bold">atmosphere/contents</code> folder. This may be a good option if you have many files in this directory that you do not recognize and you want to clean out your SD card.</li>
            <li>Delete specific mods/cheats from the <code span class="fw-bold">atmosphere/contents</code> folder. This requires you to know which title ID corresponds to what.</li>
            <li>If you wish to keep the <code span class="fw-bold">atmosphere/contents</code> folder intact, you can hold <code span class="fw-bold">L</code> every time you boot the game.</li>

        <span class="fw-bold text-light">PokeFinder Overview</span>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>PokeFinder launches as a small window with a separate tab for each generation and multiple buttons on each tab. Select the <code class="fw-bold">Gen 8</code> tab and click the <code class="fw-bold">Raid</code> button to open a larger window titled <code class="fw-bold">Gen 8 Raids</code>. For the purposes of this guide, the <code class="fw-bold">Gen 8 Raids</code> window will be referred to as the "main window." Here, we can configure the program to search raids and calculate upcoming advances based on user-defined search criteria.</p>

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">Main Window Feature Overview</span></h6>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Left Side -</span> Specify search conditions to target specific raid dens, and input seed and # of advances to search.</li>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Center -</span> Specify raid details, such as species, raid type (Normal/Rare), and difficulty (star count).</li>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Right Side -</span> Add search filters for IVs, Nature, Shiny Status, Gender, and Ability; filters are combined.</li>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Top -</span> Manage your profiles; this lets you store each game's version, 5 digit TID/SID, and presence of charms.</li>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Bottom -</span> View all search results that match your filters.</li>
        </ul>

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">Profiles</span></h6>
        <p>It is important to a set up a basic PokeFinder profile. For Max Raids, only the game version is necessary. This allows PokeFinder to display the correct version-exclusive species details for your game's raid dens. Everything else is optional and will NOT affect raid predictions. Select your profile in the dropdown menu at the top of the main window after creation.</p>

        <details>
            <summary><span class="fw-bold">Technical Details</span></summary>
            <p>Pok&eacute;mon found in Max Raid battles always have the same Shiny status for all participants. For the game to do this, the raid seed generates a PID and a fake trainer's TID/SID. If the PID is shiny for the fake trainer, it will be shiny for everyone, and if it is nonshiny for the fake trainer, it will be nonshiny for everyone. After each participant captures the Pok&eacute;mon, its PID is modified for the player's TID/SID to ensure that the original shiny status is maintained. This is why entering your correct TID/SID into your PokeFinder profile is NOT required.</p>

            <p>However, if you enter correct IDs into your profile, the PID will be calculated based on your TID/SID. This is useful for trading communities that require proof that the Pok&eacute;mon was obtained through legitimate means since the PID will be correct in the search table.</p>

            <h6><span class="fw-bold">Finding your 5 digit TID/SID</span></h6>
            <ol>
                <li>Load your save file into PKHeX, then right-click and <code class="fw-bold">View</code> a self-obtained Pok&eacute;mon.</li>
                <li>Select the OT/Misc tab and hover over the TID field with your mouse.</li>
                <li>Your 5 digit TID/SID will be displayed in a tooltip. These are the values PokeFinder expects.</li>

    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>Before you continue, you should understand the difference between stock raid dens and event dens.</p>

        <p>Stock raid dens are location-specific, and their beams can either be red (Common/Normal) or purple (Rare). These raid dens are always available, even if you have not connected online. You can see what appears in each location using <a href="https://www.serebii.net/swordshield/maxraidbattledens.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Serebii's Max Raid Battle Dens</a> page.</p>

        <p>Event dens are obtained by connecting online to receive the Wild Area News. These dens appear anywhere on the map and contain unique tables of available Pok&eacute;mon for a limited time. These raid beams are always red. You can see what appeared in each event distribution using <a href="https://www.serebii.net/swordshield/maxraidbattles/eventden-finale.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Serebii's Max Raid Event Dens</a> page.</p>

        <p>In most cases, you should have the final event distribution active in-game. Information about injecting older Wild Area News can be found in <a href="https://projectpokemon.org/tutorials/save-editing/gen-8_157/block-editing-r106/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this ProjectPok&eacute;mon tutorial</a>. No further support for Wild Area News injection will be provided in this guide.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>In this section, you will learn how to find the Den ID for your chosen raid den. The Den ID is used to identify which Pok&eacute;mon are available in a stock raid. Later on, we will use it to find the correct raid seed for your den, whether it is a stock den or event den.</p>

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">Finding Den ID</span></h6>
        <p>On the initial, smaller window that first appears when launching PokeFinder, the navigation menu at the top lists tools used for different games. Under <code class="fw-bold">Gen 8 Tools</code>, there is an option for <code class="fw-bold">Den Map</code>. This tool opens in a subwindow and can be used to find your chosen raid den's ID more easily.</p>

        <p>We can match the in-game location of a raid den to its location on PokeFinder's Den Map to find the corresponding Den ID.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>If you are planning to RNG manipulate a stock den, use Serebii to find a raid den that contains your desired Pok&eacute;mon. Otherwise, find an event den, which can be confirmed by checking the Pok&eacute;mon inside versus what normally appears in that raid den.</li>
            <li>Throw a Wishing Piece into the den and confirm the species matches the tables on Serebii. If the species does not match, you are not standing by the correct den in-game.</li>
            <li>Take note of the map (Wild Area, IoA, or CT) and the area (e.g. Dusty Bowl) for your selected den.</li>
            <li>Open the <code class="fw-bold">Den Map</code> subwindow on PokeFinder.</li>
            <li>Select the correct map from the first dropdown menu (Wild Area, IoA, or CT).</li>
            <li>Under the second dropdown menu, check each option that matches the area until the red dot appears in the same place as your chosen raid den.</li>
            <li>The number that appears in front of the location in the second dropdown menu is the Den ID. Take note of this value.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you found your raid den at <code class="fw-bold">76: Dusty Bowl</code>, then the Den ID is <code class="fw-bold">76</code>, the area is <code class="fw-bold">Dusty Bowl</code>, and the map is <code class="fw-bold">Wild Area</code>.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Go back to the main PokeFinder window to enter this information.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Confirm that the correct profile has been selected at the top.</li>
                <li>From the <code class="fw-bold">Location</code> dropdown, select the correct map if you are manipulating a stock den, or <code class="fw-bold">Event</code> if you are manipulating an event den.</li>
                <li>From the <code class="fw-bold">Den</code> dropdown, select the Den ID you found earlier if you are manipulating a stock den, or the correct Wild Area News Event if you are manipulating an event den.</li>
                <li>If this is a stock den, select the correct Den rarity (Normal/Rare) from the <code class="fw-bold">Rarity</code> dropdown. This does not matter for event dens.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Confirm that the species selection in PokeFinder matches Serebii.</li>
            <li>Remember the Den ID you found for the next step.</li>

        <p>Luxray is a Switch tool used for automating the (otherwise tedious) date skipping process. It can be launched from the Switch Homebrew Menu. As mentioned above, the den seed advances by one for each day that passes. Luxray can be used to alter the system clock and make the game believe that a day has passed to advance den seeds.</p>

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">Using Luxray</span></h6>
        <p>Upon launching you will be presented with a calculator-style application with three main features:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Set -</span> Adjust the network time by the number of days entered. Useful for changing the weather.</li>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Step -</span> Date skips based on the number of days entered. Used to automate date-skipping.</li>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">NTP -</span> Synchronizes the date and time back to network time. This should be done after every date-skipping session.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Date &amp; Time must be synced via the internet in the <code class="fw-bold">System Settings</code> in order to use Luxray.</p>

    <span class="fw-bold">Date Skipping Safety -</span> It is highly advised that you stay within reasonable Switch times when date skipping with Luxray. The lowest settable date is January 1, 2000, and the highest settable date is December 31, 2060. Use <code class="fw-bold">NTP</code> or <code class="fw-bold">Set</code> to adjust the clock if you are going out of bounds.
