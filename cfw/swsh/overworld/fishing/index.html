<p>This page provides information and worked examples for how you can RNG abuse Pokémon from <span class="fw-bold">Fishing encounters.</span> The whole process will be covered here, from finding a desirable location to use to achieving the final result.</p>

<p>Fishing encounters are not guaranteed to be the same species every time, much like a Symbol encounter. The Pokémon species is instead based on an encounterslot value of 0-99. Encounterslot values will change with the weather, the weather can potentially change every time the clock hits 00:00.</p>

  <p><span class="fw-bold">Using Whiscash as the example:</span> The location for this encounter given by Encounter Lookup is Slumbering Weald, and the expected weather condition is sunny. The search filters have been set to search for any Shiny with any Mark.</p>

  <p>Whiscash has an encounterslot value of 0-59, and the Pokedex tells us that we have 500 KOs for Whiscash, this information has now been reflected inside the encounter filters found on the left-side of the Main Window.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
      <h6><span class="fw-bold">The KO mechanic & Brilliant Aura</span></h6>
      <p>The KO Mechanic provides a boost to the rates of Shiny & Brilliant Aura Pokémon, you can find the correct value by opening the Pokedéx screen of the Pokémon you are hunting. You can find more details about the odds boosts on <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Brilliant_Pok%C3%A9mon#Appearance_rate">Bulbapedia</a>.</p>

      <p>Brilliant Aura boosts the amount of guaranteed 31 IVs a Pokémon has, only Pokémon from symbol/fishing encounters can have this trait. This makes fishing encounters ideal for those who are hunting for high IV wild Pokémon.</p><hr />

      <h6><span class="fw-bold">Dex Recommendations & Ability Boosts</span></h6>

      <p>Dex recommendations can be found by opening the Pokedex, when a Pokemon is recommended the encounterslot value for that specific Pokemon is boosted.</p>

      <p>Abilities like Lightning Rod, Harvest & Storm Drain boost the encounterslot value for Pokemon of specific types.</p>

      <p>Both of these boosting methods are NOT accounted for inside SWSH_OWRNG_Generator_GUI. Avoid using Dexrec or ability boosts in case of inaccuracies.</p>

  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">The Process</h1>
 </div><hr />

 <p>The goal is to spawn the fishing pool on the calculated target frame displayed by the generator search results. Once a fishing pool has spawned in the overworld the stats and internal details are set in stone.</p>
    
 <p>From here the it is assumed that your encounter & search filters have been properly configured (see Figure 1). The advancement methods used are throughout this guide are listed inside the table found on the main page.</p>

    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Game Setup:</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>For Fishing encounters, the best place to stand would be directly next to the fishing pool that contains the target Pokémon. Avoid standing in areas that trigger other wild Pokémon or Static encounters to spawn where possible.</p>

    <p>The above location is considered an ideal location, there are a low number of NPCs around and no extra spawned Pokémon present. The player is also stood directly next to the fishing pool.</p>

    <p>Slumbering Weald is located near the players house, it is a notably quiet area in calm weather conditions, the speed of advancements will depend on your location, NPC count & weather.</p>

    <blockquote>If you cannot find a good position to stand in, you can knock out any static spawns that block your path to the Pokémon, it will remain despawned until return to the area after a date has been changed.</blockquote>

<p>We found one! After searching for a desirable result we can see a shiny, Hardy natured Whiscash in a cluster on advances 271-274. When searching for target frames you may notice that they appear in clusters, clusters are a group of frames that produce the same end result. The larger the cluster, the better chances you have of hitting your target frame!</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold">It's time to begin advancing towards the target frame!</span></p>

<hr /><div class="title" style="background-color: #0c0038;">
  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Advancing Towards the Target!</h1>
</div><hr />

<p>After setting up your search filters and standing in the correct position in-game, you will need to calculate the amount of NPCs in the area and the base delay of the encounter. Doing both of these things will provide the best possible chances of hitting the correct target frame.</p>

    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Delay Calculation & NPC Calibration:</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <h6 span class="fw-bold">Delay Calculation</h6>
    <ol>
      <li>Pause the game, then disconnect and reconnect to the main window. The number inside the <code class="fw-bold">Curr. Adv.</code> field should now be 0.</li>
      <li>Unpause the game and run around to make the fishing pool spawn in the overworld, take note of the frame it was spawned on.</li>
      <li>Initiate the encounter, the press the <code class="fw-bold">Read Encounter</code> button to see the details of the Pokémon you are in battle with.</li>
      <li>If this is the Pokémon you expected, your delay will be 0. Otherwise, you will need to find the frame you actually hit.</li>
      <li>If you did not hit the expected encounter, search for Pokémon you hit using the Encounter Lookup, then click the row that matches your current location & weather.</li>
      <li>Search using the main window again to find the frame you actually hit, you can filter for IVs for a more specific result output.</li>
      <li>If you did not hit the expected encounter, filter for the IVs of the Pokémon you are in battle with to find the frame you actually hit.</li>
      <li>Subtract the frame the Pokémon was spawned on from the frame you actually hit. This will be your delay for that particular encounter.</li>
     </ol>

     <blockquote><span class="fw-bold">For example:</span> If we spawned the fishing pool on frame 150, but the Pokémon we are in battle with was generated on frame 152, the calculated delay is 2.</blockquote>

    <h6 span class="fw-bold">NPC Calibration</h6>
    <ol>
      <li>Pause the game then disconnect and reconnect to the program, if done correctly, the number inside the <code span class="fw-bold">Curr. Adv</code> field of the main window should now be 0.</li>
      <li>Click the <code span class="fw-bold">Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> button at the top of the main window to open the tab. Your seeds should be visible in the correct fields automatically.</li>
      <li>Close the pause menu then quickly re-open it, note of the number of advancements that have occurred from doing so (see <code span class="fw-bold">Curr. Adv</code>).</li>  
      <li>Type 0 into the <code span class="fw-bold">NPCs</code> field and search. Gradually increase by 1 until the number inside the top row of the <code span class="fw-bold">Jump</code> column matches the number inside the <code span class="fw-bold">Curr. Adv</code> field.</li>
      <li>Close and re-open the pause menu a few times to make sure that the calculated NPC count is correct.</li>
    </ol>

  </div>
  </div><br>

  <p>Take note of the calculated delay and NPC count, you will need this information in order to reach the correct target frame later. Do not change position after calculating the number of NPCs, as this is subject to change depending on positioning.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
      <h6 class="fw-bold">Step-by-step tutorial:</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Advance towards your target frame using any of the methods listed inside the table on the <a href="https://billo-guides.github.io/cfw/swsh/overworld">main page</a>. Consider date skipping to advance large distances.</li><p></p>
        <li>Once you are close a few thousand frames away from the target, head back to the correct position in-game (see Figure 2).</li><p></p>
        <li>Pause the game, then disconnect and reconnect to the Main Window and press the search button again. This will be the new target frame.</li><p></p>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>From this point it is recommended to advance towards the target using only menu close prediction & animation advancements. These methods advance frames in small increments, making them easy to keep track of.</blockquote>

      <ul>
        <li>Open the Menu Close Advances Viewer tab, and type the number of NPCs (calculated earlier) into the <code span class="fw-bold">NPCs</code> field.</li><p></p>
        <li>Then type your target frame into the <code span class="fw-bold">+</code> field and search, factor in the delay that was calculated earlier (Example: <code span class="fw-bold">1000 (target) - 3 (delay) = 997 (new target)</code>).</li><p></p>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>If you are unable to find your target frame in the search results, use animations to advance the RNG state by 1, click the <code span class="fw-bold">Update States</code> button on the main window & repeat the above step. Do this until your target frame is visible.</blockquote>

      <ul>
        <li>If it is possible to land directly onto your target frame using menu close prediction, open and close the pause menu until closing the pause menu a single time will land you onto your target frame.</li><p></p>
        <li>If you cannot hit your target using menu close prediction, get as close as you can using this method. You will then need to be ready to use movement animations to hit your target after the final unpause instead.</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>Be sure to test how many advancements occur from movement to get an idea of how many movements you need to do to hit the target frame. Typically a single movement will advance 1-2 frames depending on your location.</blockquote>

      <ul>
        <li>Close the pause menu (do movement advancements here if necessary). Once you have landed onto your target frame, quickly run around without letting go of the control stick to spawn the fishing pool, then fish the Pokémon to initiate a battle.</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>If you encountered an unexpected result, this either means you missed your target frame (too slow), the encounter did not spawn on time, or your delay is incorrect. Confirm your delay using the <a href="#delay-npc-count-symbol-cfw">above mentioned method</a> and retry.</blockquote>
