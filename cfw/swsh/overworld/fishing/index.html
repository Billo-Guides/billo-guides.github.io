</div><hr />

<p>This page provides information and worked examples for how you can RNG abuse Pokémon from <span class="fw-bold">Fishing encounters.</span> The whole process will be covered here, from finding a desirable location to use to achieving the final result.</p>

<p>Fishing encounters are not guaranteed to be the same species every time, much like a Symbol encounter. The Pokémon species is instead based on an encounterslot value of 0-99. Encounterslot values will change with the weather, the weather can potentially change every time the clock hits 00:00.</p>

  <p><span class="fw-bold">Using Whiscash as the example:</span> The location for this encounter given by Encounter Lookup is Slumbering Weald, and the expected weather condition is sunny. The search filters have been set to search for any Shiny with any Mark.</p>

  <p>Whiscash has an encounterslot value of 0-59, and the Pokedex tells us that we have 500 KOs for Whiscash, this information has now been reflected inside the encounter filters found on the left-side of the Main Window.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
      <h6><span class="fw-bold">The KO mechanic & Brilliant Aura</span></h6>
      <p>The KO Mechanic provides a boost to the rates of Shiny & Brilliant Aura Pokémon, you can find the correct value by opening the Pokedéx screen of the Pokémon you are hunting. You can find more details about the odds boosts on <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Brilliant_Pok%C3%A9mon#Appearance_rate">Bulbapedia</a>.</p>

      <p>Brilliant Aura boosts the amount of guaranteed 31 IVs a Pokémon has, only Pokémon from symbol/fishing encounters can have this trait. This makes fishing encounters ideal for those who are hunting for high IV wild Pokémon.</p><hr />

      <h6><span class="fw-bold">Dex Recommendations & Ability Boosts</span></h6>

      <p>Dex recommendations can be found by opening the Pokedex, when a Pokemon is recommended the encounterslot value for that specific Pokemon is boosted.</p>

      <p>Abilities like Lightning Rod, Harvest & Storm Drain boost the encounterslot value for Pokemon of specific types.</p>

      <p>Both of these boosting methods are NOT accounted for inside SWSH_OWRNG_Generator_GUI. Avoid using Dexrec or ability boosts in case of inaccuracies.</p>

  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">The Process</h1>
 </div><hr />

 <p>The goal is to spawn the fishing pool on the calculated target frame displayed by the generator search results. Once a fishing pool has spawned in the overworld the stats and internal details are set in stone.</p>
    
 <p>From here the it is assumed that your encounter & search filters have been properly configured (see Figure 1). The advancement methods used are throughout this guide are listed inside the table found on the main page.</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 2 -</span> Game setup<p></p>
<img src="./images/fishing/figure-2-in-game-setup-fishing.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Game Setup:</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>For Fishing encounters, the best place to stand would be directly next to the fishing pool that contains the target Pokémon. Avoid standing in areas that trigger other wild Pokémon or Static encounters to spawn where possible.</p>

    <p>The above location is considered an ideal location, there are a low number of NPCs around and no extra spawned Pokémon present. The player is also stood directly next to the fishing pool.</p>

    <p>Slumbering Weald is located near the players house, it is a notably quiet area in calm weather conditions, the speed of advancements will depend on your location, NPC count & weather.</p>

    <div class="alert" style="background-color: #c0bdbd;">
      If you cannot find a good position to stand in, you can knock out any static spawns that block your path to the Pokémon, it will remain despawned until return to the area after a date has been changed.

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 3 -</span> Target found!<p></p>
<img src="./images/fishing/figure-3-target-found-fishing.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<p>We found one! After searching for a desirable result we can see a shiny, Hardy natured Whiscash in a cluster on advances 271-274. When searching for target frames you may notice that they appear in clusters, clusters are a group of frames that produce the same end result. The larger the cluster, the better chances you have of hitting your target frame!</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold">It's time to begin advancing towards the target frame!</span></p>

<hr /><div class="title" style="background-color: #0c0038;">
  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Advancing Towards the Target!</h1>
</div><hr />

<p>After setting up your search filters and standing in the correct position in-game, you will need to calculate the amount of NPCs in the area and the base delay of the encounter. Doing both of these things will provide the best possible chances of hitting the correct target frame.</p>

<div class="card border-dark">
  <div class="anchored card-header" style="background-color: #0c0038;" id="delay-npc-count-fishing-cfw">
    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Delay Calculation & NPC Calibration:</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <h6 span class="fw-bold">Delay Calculation</h6>
    <ol>
      <li>Aim for a target frame, such as any shiny Pokémon.</li>
      <li>Spawn the Pokémon on the desired target frame, then initiate the encounter.</li>
      <li>Take note of the frame that you believe the Pokémon was spawned on.</li>
      <li>Read the Pokémon you are in battle with using the <code class="fw-bold">Read Encounter</code> button.</li>
      <li>If this is the Pokémon you expected, your delay will be 0.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, perform a filterless search to find the Pokémon you hit.</li>
      <li>Subtract the frame the Pokémon was spawned on from the frame you actually hit.</li>
      <li>This will be your delay for that particular encounter.</li>
    </ol>

    <h6 span class="fw-bold">NPC Calibration</h6>
    <ol>
      <li>Pause the game then disconnect and reconnect to the program, if done correctly, the number inside the <code span class="fw-bold">Curr. Adv</code> field of the main window should now be 0.</li>
      <li>Click the <code span class="fw-bold">Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> button at the top of the main window to open the tab. Your seeds should be visible in the correct fields automatically.</li>
      <li>Close the pause menu then quickly re-open it, note of the number of advancements that have occured from doing so (see <code span class="fw-bold">Curr. Adv</code>).</li>  
      <li>Type 0 into the <code span class="fw-bold">NPCs</code> field and search. Gradually increase by 1 until the number inside the top row of the <code span class="fw-bold">Jump</code> column matches the number inside the <code span class="fw-bold">Curr. Adv</code> field.</li>
      <li>Close and re-open the pause menu a few times to make sure that the calculated NPC count is correct.</li>
    </ol>

  </div>
  </div><br>

  <p>Take note of the calculated delay and NPC count, you will need this information in order to reach the correct target frame later. Do not change position after calculating the number of NPCs, as this is subject to change depending on positioning.</p>

      <span class="fw-bold text-light">Hitting Your Target Frame:</span>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">

      <h6 class="fw-bold">Step-by-step tutorial:</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Advance towards your target frame using any of the methods listed inside the table on the <a href="https://billo-guides.github.io/cfw/swsh/overworld">main page</a>. Consider date skipping to advance large distances.</li><p></p>
        <li>Once you are close a few thousand frames away from the target, head back to the correct position in-game (see Figure 2).</li><p></p>
        <li>Pause the game, then disconnect and reconnect to the Main Window and press the search button again. This will be the new target frame.</li><p></p>
      </ul>

      <div class="alert" style="background-color: #c0bdbd;">
        From this point it is recommended to advance towards the target using only menu close prediction & animations. These types of advancements advance in small increments and are easy to keep track of. 
      </div>

      <ul>
        <li>Open the Menu Close Advances Viewer tab, and type the number of NPCs (calculated earlier) into the <code span class="fw-bold">NPCs</code> field.</li><p></p>
        <li>Then type your target frame into the <code span class="fw-bold">+</code> field and search, factor in the delay that was calculated earlier.</li><p></p>
      </ul>

      <div class="alert" style="background-color: #c0bdbd;">
        E.g - If the calculated delay is 3, and your target frame is frame 1000, your new target frame is now 997. If you are unable to find your target frame in the search results, use animations to advance the RNG state by 1, repeat until your target frame is visible.
      </div>

      <ul>
        <li>Open and close the pause menu until closing the menu a single time lands onto your target frame, according to the <code span class="fw-bold">Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> prediction.</li><p></p>
        <li>Close the pause menu and run around close to the pond to spawn the fishing pool (without letting the stick rest as this will advance the RNG state). </li><p></p>
        <li>Confirm you have hit the expected result by initiating the encounter, then clicking the <code span class="fw-bold">Read Encounter</code> button when in battle.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="alert" style="background-color: #c0bdbd;">
       If you encountered an unexpected result, this either means you missed your target frame (too slow) or your delay is incorrect. Confirm your delay using the <a href="#delay-npc-count-fishing-cfw">above mentioned method</a> and try again from the beginning.
      </div>

    </div>
    </div><br>

  <p><span class="fw-bold">By using menu close prediction and animations to keep track of inputs, we were able to hit out target frame!</span></p>
