</div>

<hr />

This guide will provide in-depth coverage of how to RNG abuse all types of overworld-based encounters in Sword/Shield using the SWSH Overworld RNG Generator by <a href="https://github.com/LegoFigure11LegoFigure11">LegoFigure11</a>. 
Overworld RNG abuse is best utilized to help players obtain shiny and/or marked Pokémon from wild encounters! This can also be used to calculate other internal values such as IVs, nature and gender.<br /> <br />

<span class="fw-bold">This guide assumes you are using a CFW Switch console running Atmosphere.</span> If you are not running CFW fear not, you can find an alternative CFWless guide here!<br /> <br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Getting Started:</span></h3>
<u>You will need:</u>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/LegoFigure11/swsh-overworld-rng-gui/releases">SWSH Overworld RNG Generator</a> - Version 2.1.0 or later</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/Koi-3088/sys-usb-botbase/releases">sys-usb-botbase</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/spacemeowx2/ldn_mitm/releases/">ldn-mitm</a></li>
</ul>

<u>Installation Instructions:</u>
<ol>
  <li>Download and extract all the contents from the <code>SWSH_OWRNG_Generator_GUI.zip</code> into an empty folder.</li>
  <li>Download and extract all the contents from the sys-usb-botbase and ldn-mitm downloads into an empty folder.</a></li>
  <li>Place the <code>atmosphere</code> folder(s) from these downloads onto the root of your Switch SD card and reboot the console.</li>
</ol>

You can check the <code>atmosphere/contents</code> folder of your SD card and make sure the <code>430000000000000B</code> & <code>4200000000000010</code> folders are present before rebooting your console if you wish.<br /><br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Tool Setup:</span></h3>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 1/2 -</span> Main window overview<br />
<img src="./overworld/images/main-page/figure-1-seedfinder.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

This is the main tab of the generator with default configurations. To start with, enter the local IP address of your console into the <code>Switch IP:</code> field of the generator and click <code>Connect</code>. You should now see the text <code>Status: Connected</code> and a number displaying in the <code>Curr. Adv.:</code> field. <u>This is an indication of a successful connection to the generator.</u><br /><br />

<img src="./overworld/images/main-page/figure-2-seedfinder-connected.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

Once connected you'll notice <span class="fw-bold">that the State [0]/State[1] & TID/SID fields are automatically filled!</span> You do not need to fill in this information manually.<br /><br />

You should check the <code>Shiny Charm</code> and <code>Mark Charm</code> boxes if those items are present your save file. It's recommended to aquire both of these items before starting.<br /><br />

<u>Let's take a closer look at the main window before moving onto the next section:</u>
<ul>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">The field below Init. adv. is the frame range or amount of frames to search through.</span> Set this to an amount you are comfortable with.</li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">You can use the IVs/Shiny/Mark filters to search for specific internal details.</span> On specific encounter types you can even filter for Brilliant Aura!</li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">The checkboxes on the left should be filled out according to your desired hunt.</span> We can quickly find this information using the <code>Encounter Lookup</code> tab of the generator.</li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Read Encounter will read any wild encounter mid-battle.</span> This can be used to quickly troubleshoot delays. (More on this later!)</li>
</ul>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 3 -</span> Encounter Lookup tab overview<br />
<img src="./overworld/images/main-page/figure-3-encounter-lookup.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

Click <code>Encounter Lookup</code> in the navigation bar and type the species of Pokemon you intend on hunting in the search bar then select it in the dropdown menu. You will now see a list of all the possible wild encounters for that Pokemon, by selecting a row you will automatically enter all the required information into the main window, be sure to select the one that applies to you. Once you have done so you can exit back to the main window.<br /><br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Monitoring the RNG state:</span></h3>
Once we connect our console to the tool we are able to monitor the RNG state in real-time. The number in the <code>Curr. adv.</code> field will display the amount of frames that have passed since we initially connected to the tool. 
The amount frames that advance naturally will heavily depend on your in-game environment and location. <u>For the purposes of this guide we will be referring to slow-paced natural advancements as "Quiet" and fast-faced as "Noisy"</u>. <br /><br />

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Environment Control:</span></h5>
The more noisy the environment the more difficult it becomes to control the speed of frame advancements, which in turn will increase the difficulty of actually hitting a desirable target frame.<br /><br />

<u>There are three main contributors to the amount of natural noise in an area, these are:</u>
<ol>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Location -</span> Some areas will simply be more noisy than others.</li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Weather -</span> Extreme weather conditions such as rain, thunderstorm and sandstorm will have a large effect on noise.</li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Other Pokémon that are present -</span> Having other Pokémon spawned will advance the RNG state moreso than if there were none spawned.</li>
</ol>

<u>Examples:</u><br />
- In Crown Tundra the RNG is naturally quiet, so we will have a relatively easy time hunting a Pokémon in clear weather conditions.<br />
- In Isle of Armor the RNG is naturally noisy, so we will have a more difficult time hunting Pokémon in general.<br />
- If we added rainy weather to either of these situations we would increase the amount of natural noise, and further increase the instability.<br /><br />

In all cases it's best to target a Pokémon in a quiet area when possible for the sake of simplicity. (Some Pokémon can only be hunted in unstable overworld environments.)<br /><br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Advancing the RNG state:</span></h3>
<u>Multiple in-game actions can be used to advance the RNG state with varying influence, these include:</u>
<ol>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Player movement -</span> Each time the player moves then stops by use of the control stick the RNG state will advance a small amount.</li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Active NPCs -</span> Standing near an NPC will "activate" them, this will advance the RNG state quite rapidly.</li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Rotom Bike -</span> Mounting and dismounting the bike will advance the RNG state a small amount, but moreso than player movement.</li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Day skipping -</span> We can use the day skip feature of the tool to advance the RNG state rapidly and will be our go-to mathod for large amounts of frame advancements.</li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Menuing -</span> Performing actions while the pause menu is open will advance the RNG state a small amount, such as opening the map or making Pokémon do animations on the summary screen. This is primarily used for fishing encounters</li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Flying -</span> We can fly into an area to advance the RNG state too! This is used primarily for hunting Articuno, Zapdos and Moltres.</li>
</ol>

<span class="fw-bold">The amount of frames that advance by Day Skipping is heavily influenced by the amount of Pokémon currently in your boxes, the number will increase drastically if you store more Pokémon.</span> This does not include Pokémon in eggs!<br /><br />

  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">The Process</h1>
</div>

This portion of the guide will cover the process of RNG abusing a Pokémon from each type of encounter. The types of encounter we will look at will be <u>Static, Symbol, and Hidden encounters</u>, we will also cover Galarian Articuno, Zapdos and Moltres on a seperate page.
Each method we dive into will have a differing approach, so be sure to read through and grab an understanding of the type of encounter you are doing before making attempts. <br /><br />

<u>First, lets give definitions to each type of encounter...</u><br />
<ul>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Static -</span> These are the 100% chance-of-encounter spawns with an overworld model. <u>Cannot be Brilliant Aura.</u></li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Symbol -</span> These are the by-chance encounters in the grass with an overworld model. <u>Can be Brilliant Aura.</u></li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Hidden -</span> These are the by-chance encounters in the grass that do not have an overworld model, they're indicated by the "!" symbol when walking into a patch of grass. <u>Cannot be Brilliant Aura.</u></li>
</ul>

<span class="fw-bold">Great! Now we know all the terminology, it's time to get started!</span><br /><br />
Decide on the type of encounter you want to do, to do this simply search the species you wish to hunt on the <code>Encounter Lookup</code> tab of the generator as seen above and pick one from the list.<br /><br />
