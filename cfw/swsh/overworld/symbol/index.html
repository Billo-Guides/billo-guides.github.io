<hr />

If you made it this far, it must mean you have an interest in RNG abusing Pokémon from symbol encounters! This page will cover the whole process, from finding a desirable location to achieving a final result.<br /> <br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Getting Started:</span></h3>
<u>Before starting, do the following:</u>
<ul>
  <li>Open the GUI and click on the <code>Encounter Lookup</code> button at the top of the main window. This will open the Encounter Lookup tab.</li>
  <li>Type the species name of the Pokémon you are hunting into the empty field, this will bring up a list of every possible encounter and has all the information you need for the main window.</li>
  <li>Scroll down the list of encounters and click on one of the rows displaying a symbol encounter, this will automatically enter the information into the main window.</li>
  <li>Head to the location in-game, change the date until you meet the correct weather condition, then stand near the spawn point of the Pokémon.</li>
  <li>Run far enough away to despawn the Pokémon, knock out any present static spawns and save the game.</li>
  <li>Press the Home button on your controller, click <code>Connect</code> on the main window of the tool.</li>
</ul>

When searching possible encounters it is suggested to pick an encounter in a quiet area with calm weather to reduce the amount of noise significantly. Noise is area specific, to test how much noise an area has, head to the location in-game and connect your console to the GUI while standing in the overworld and monitor the speed of advancements.<br /> <br />

<h5><span class="fw-bold">The KO mechanic:</span></h5>
This references the <code>Number Battled:</code> screen of the Pokédex and is used to boost the odds of (Shiny) Brilliant Aura Pokémon. On this screen you are able to view the total amount of KO'd Pokémon per species in your entire save file.<br /> <br />

<span class="fw-bold">The number of Pokémon battled is important to symbol encounters and needs to be entered into the tool manually or you will not get accurate results from the generator!</span> Check the amount of KOs you have on the Pokemon you are hunting before starting.<br /> <br />

Want to know the odds based on the total amount of KOs? <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Brilliant_Pok%C3%A9mon">This article on Bulbapedia</a> will tell you everything you need to know.<br /> <br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Time to get to work!</span></h3>
The goal is to walk towards the grass and spawn the Pokémon on the calculated target frame given by the generator. The advancement methods used are listed in detail on the main page of this guide.<br /><br />

If you plan to use the <code>DaySkip</code> feature you should take a moment to monitor your advances to avoid overshooting. Connect to the GUI and skip 1 day at a time to get a rough estimate amount of advances per day skipped.<br /><br />

Brilliant Aura guarantees 2 full 31 IVs, players who desire high IV wild caught Pokémon may wish to filter for Brilliant Aura.<br /><br />

<u>The generator does not currently provide support for mechanics that boost the encounter rates of specific Pokémon, such as Dexrec boosts or abilities like Storm Drain. Using spawn boosters like these may output incorrect results.</u><br /><br />

We will be aiming for a Shiny, Marked Swablu with a Brilliant Aura in Giant's Bed. You can be more specific with the filters if you wish, such as filtering for a specific mark or specific IVs.<br /><br />

<u>Using Swablu as the example:</u><br />
- The <code>Encounter Lookup</code> tab tells us that Swablu has an encounter slot range of 80-94, a level range of 60-65 and is a symbol encounter in Overcast weather. It also tells us Swablu does not hold a random item and has 7 potential Egg Moves.<br />
- Clicking the row that applies to our encounter will enter all the information we need into the main window.<br />
- Our Pokédex tells us we have >500 KOs on Swablu.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Let's enter this information into the main window by clicking the row that matches our conditions!</span><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 1 -</span> Tool setup<br />
<img src="./images/symbol/figure-1-encounter-lookup-symbol-swablu.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Awesome, everything looks good!</span> Time to find an ideal position to stand in-game and set the weather condition.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 2 -</span> Game setup<br />
<img src="./images/symbol/figure-2-in-game-setup.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<u>This location in Giant's Bed is ideal, there are no NPCs around and there are no spawned Pokémon present.</u> Giant's Bed is located in Crown Tundra which is a notably quiet area in calm weather conditions.<br /><br />

Once the main window is filled in correctly & you are stood in a good position in-game, you can begin looking for target frames by clicking the search button on the generator.<br /><br />

<u>If your results are not desirable, repeat the following:</u>
<ol>
  <li>Disconnect your Switch from the tool.</li>
  <li>Restart your game and enter the overworld.</li>
  <li>Enter the pause or Home menu and reconnect your Switch to the tool.</li>
  <li>Search again, do this until you have desirable results.</li>
</ol>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure  3 -</span> Target found!<br />
<img src="./images/symbol/figure-3-target-found-symbol.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">We found one!</span> A shiny, Modest natured Swablu in a cluster on advances 2007-2009. These are the "target frames" and the aim will be to spawn Swablu in the overworld on any of these frames.<br /><br />

Once a Pokémon is spawned in the overworld the stats and internal details (such as PID/EC) are generated and set in stone, this is why it is only important to spawn the Pokémon in the overworld on the correct frame. <span class="fw-bold">Don't let the Pokémon despawn after you spawn it in the overworld!</span><br /><br />

It's common to see "clusters" or "groups" of frames that produce the same result when searching for a target. Aiming for large clusters is recommended as this will provide more chances for the player to spawn the Pokémon on the correct frame.<br /><br />

<u>Advancing towards the target (Step-by-step example):</u><br />
<ul>
  <li>The target is 2007-2009 advances away, based on local testing the delay for symbol encounters in this area is 2. This means the target frames for this attempt are frame 2005-2007.</li>
  <li>Stand close to a patch of grass in the area, advance towards the target frame using bike or using spawned overworld Pokémon in the area. You can use DaySkip to advance large distances quickly too!</li>
  <li>Once close enough (within ~1000 frames), stand near to the patch of grass, far enough away to not have any spawned Pokémon in the grass.</li>
  <li>From this point it's recommended to only advance by opening and closing the menu and using player movement/bike advancements.</li>
  <li>Open and close the pause menu with X, take note of how many the number of advancements that have passed from doing so. Repeat this process a few times and then take the highest number of advances from your results.</li>
  <li>Advance closer to your target (within ~100 frames) and pause the game by pressing X.</li>
  <li>Use animation advances to get close towards your target frame, factor in the number of advances that pass from closing the menu. (For example: We get 5 advances from closing the menu and our target is 50 advances away, only 45 animation advances will be required as we'd pick up the remaining 5 from closing the pause menu.)</li>
  <li>Close the menu and run towards the grass to spawn the encounter, player movement advancements will not occur until the control stick is in a resting state. This gives the best chance at spawning the encounter on the correct frame.</li>
</ul>

You can be creative with the methods you use to advance the RNG state.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">We hit our target frame!</span> If you believe you spawned the Pokémon on the correct frame, run towards it and initiate the encounter, once you are in-battle use the <code>Read Encounter</code> feature of the generator to confirm the Pokémon you are in battle with matches the output of the generator.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 5/6/7 -</span> Result found!<br />

The Swablu matches the output of the tool, mission accomplished! Espeon in party slot 1 with the ability Syncronize was used to determine the nature, using a Pokémon with this ability will make the nature of any overworld Pokémon match the nature of yours.<br /><br />

Different areas & environments can have a drastic influence on delay, if you are missing targets when you believe you should be finding results, you should consider reading the Troubleshooting Encounters section down below.<br /><br />

<hr />

<div class="bg-secondary title">
  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Troubleshooting Encounters</h1>
</div>

<hr />

This section covers how to troubleshoot encounters and delays. If you keep missing targets, spawning in the wrong Pokémon, or can't find your result on the RNG tool, this is the place to be.<br /><br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Missing Targets:</span></h3>
The commonly occuring reasons for missing a target Pokémon are:
<ul>
  <li>Encounter spawned too late due to mistiming.</li>
  <li>There is a delay left unaccounted for.</li>
  <li>Frame was "hit" but an incorrect species of Pokémon was encountered.</li>
  <li>Information in the main window was not completely accurate.</li>
</ul>

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Encounter did not spawn or spawned too late...</span></h5>

This is a common issue players will face when tackling symbol encounters and is likely due to mistiming when spawning the Pokémon. Retry and search for a new target frame and make sure your player positioning is correct.<br /><br />

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Troubleshooting delay...</span></h5>

For the purposes of this guide, the term "delay" is used to describe the frame difference between the Pokémon we encountered and the frame the encounter was initiated on.<br /><br />

Most symbol encounters need to account for some amount of delay, this applies most to encounters in extreme weather conditions or in an otherwise unstable environment, like having other spawned Pokémon present.<br /><br />

Delay Calc - <code>frame Pokémon was generated - frame encounter was initiated = delay</code><br /><br />

We can use the <code>Read Encounter</code> feature of the tool to confirm the exact frame the encounter was generated on and calculate the delay from there. Here's how it's done!
<ul>
  <li>Aim for a target, such as any shiny Pokémon.</li>
  <li>Walk towards the grass, spawn the Pokemon and initiate an encounter. Take note of the frame the Pokémon was spawned on.</li>
  <li>Encounter the Pokémon and click the <code>Read Encounter</code> button.</li>
  <li>If you didn't find the Pokémon that you expected, do a filterless search (or search for the specific IVs of the result you found) and find the frame you hit.</li>
  <li>Subtract your target advancement from the frame you actually hit.</li>
  <li>This will be your delay for that particular encounter.</li>
</ul>

<u>When RNG abusing in unstable conditions you should record delays for multiple attempts before aiming for a target and check for any consistent delay counts. It is also advised to aim for large clusters where possible to increase your chances of actually hitting the target.</u><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 8 -</span> Delay troubleshooting example<br />
<img src="./images/symbol/figure-8-troubleshooting-delay.png" style="width:675px;height:400px"><br /><br />

We hit a shiny, but it wasn't Swablu! So what happened here? We actually hit a different frame within a shiny cluster which contained the encounter slot values for NidoranF, we can take a look by locating the exact NidoranF encounter in the <code>Encounter Lookup</code> tab, and clicking search again in the main window. <br /><br />

<u>If the Pokemon you find is non shiny you will need to be more specific with your filters, include the exact IVs displayed in the <code>Read Encounter</code> box to easily find the frame that you hit.</u><br /><br />

Make sure the <code>KO Count:</code> field is updated to match the species you are searching for! Here's a quick example:<br />
- We are seeking a Swablu and have 500 KOs according to the Pokédex.<br />
- We hit a NidoranF and have 90 KOs according to the Pokédex.<br />
- In order to find the NidoranF we are troubleshooting on the generator, we would need to enter <code>90</code> into the <count>KO Count:</code> field to match the NidoranF we are in battle with.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 9 -</span> Troubleshooting Encounter-slots<br />
<img src="./images/symbol/figure-9-finding-frame-symbol.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px"><br /><br />

Here we can see NidoranF was indeed a shiny Pokémon within the cluster, (encounterslot value of 26-51 according to <code>Encounter Lookup</code>). Our goal was frame 3,001 and we hit frame 3,003, the tool shows these values are a match 1-2 frames later than our desired target frame, we will adjust accordingly by walking into the grass 2 frames earlier next time.<br /><br />

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Cannot find result...</span></h5>
If you cannot find the Pokémon you are in battle with anywhere on the tool this is likely due to one of two reasons:
<ul>
  <li>Player was positioned too close to the spawn and the Pokémon had already been generated long before walking into it.</li>
  <li>The information entered into the main window of the tool was not completely accurate.</li>
</ul>

Try to reposition your character and see if your issue persists, if you are still having problems double check the information on the main window is entered correctly by searching it on the Encounter Lookup and clicking the correct row. <u>You must pay attention to the row you are clicking and making sure it matches your in-game environment.</u><br /><br />

That's all there is to it!<br /><br />
