    Understanding the common methods used to advance the RNG state.
</small>
<hr />

<p>Owoow tracks the amount of advances that have occured since the initial connection to the program. RNG advancements can occur naturally based on the overworld environment, or they can be forced by performing specific actions. The most useful actions are listed in the table below.</p>

<table class="table table-striped" style="width:100%" id="overworld-rng-table">

    <span class="fw-bold">Important -</span> To use the built-in date skipping features, you must install the custom sys-botbase version bundled with owoow. This version includes exclusive features not found in standard releases. Additionally, ensure that the system date and time are synced via the internet for this feature to function properly.

        <p>With the Pok&eacute;mon party list open, pressing down on the <code span class="fw-bold">Left Stick</code>/<code span class="fw-bold">Right Stick</code> causes the RNG state to advance by +1 with each press. This works similarly in the Pok&eacute;mon, but you must wait for each animation to play completely. As a ersult, using the party list is recommended since it is possible to press the sticks rapidly without having to wait for animations.</p>

        <h6 span class="fw-bold">Use Cases</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>Advancing in a predictable manner to reach a specific RNG state/advance (~1-300 advancements away).</li>

        <h6 span class="fw-bold">Use Cases</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>Simple movement can be used to get closer to a particular RNG state at a slow-medium rate (~100-500 advancements away).</li>

    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>Closing the pause menu advances the RNG state in a predictable manner based on the current number of NPCs in the area and the current weather. In most cases, closing the pause menu freezes advances for a short period of time, making this method ideal for hitting a target frame.</p>
        <p>Due to the effectiveness of this method, menu close prediction will be referenced often throughout this guide. How to calibrate NPC counts will be explained later.</p>

        <h6 span class="fw-bold">Use Cases</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>Opening and closing the in-game menu can be used to advance the RNG state without movement (~100-500 advancements away). Note that you should avoid doing this too quickly, e.g. with the <code class="fw-bold">X</code> button, because this will cause some of the flips to be ignored.</li>
            <p></p>

        <p>Keep in mind that using this method in front of activated NPCs will paradoxically cause advancements to be slower since the NPC advancements do not resume until the bike animation is done.</p>

        <h6 span class="fw-bold">Use Cases</h6>
        <ul>

        <p>The <code span class="fw-bold">Skip</code> feature of the RNG tool artificially adjusts the Switch system clock, which advances the RNG state rapidly. This can also be done manually with the PvP date skipping exploit (<a href="https://billo-guides.github.io/retail/swsh/overworld/advancing-the-rng-state#advancements-method-date-skipping">retail guide link</a>). The number of advances consumed per day skipped varies based on the number of Pok&eacute;mon currently stored in boxes (excluding eggs).

    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>Figure 9 illustrates the combination of three advancement techniques: wet weather, NPC activation, and bike bell usage. These methods collectively advance the RNG state rapidly without relying on date skipping.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Wet Weather -</span> Causes the RNG state to advance rapidly on its own. Simply change the date to one where the weather is Rain/Thunderstorm and stand in the overworld.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">NPC Activation -</span> Standing close enough to an NPC to "activate" them further increases the RNG advancement rate.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Bike Bell/Whistling -</span> Ringing the bike bell (or player whistling) introduces additional advancements. While effective, this requires some manual input.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If done correctly, you should see that the NPC is facing the player, meaning they are now "active", and each time the player rings the bike bell or whistles, the NPC will blink (see the above image for a demonstration of this).</p>

        <h6 span class="fw-bold">Examples</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>Standing next to <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/overworld/advancing-rng-state/ioa-diglett-npc.png">this NPC and his Diglett</a> in the IOA, while standing in Thunderstorm weather and ringing the bike bell, advances roughly 17,000 frames per minute.</li>
