<hr />

This portion of the guide will cover the process of RNG abusing Galarian Articuno, Zapdos, & Moltres. It will cover the whole process, from finding a desirable location to achieving a final result.<br /> <br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Getting Started:</span></h3>
<u>Before starting, do the following:</u>
<ul>
  <li>You must have met in-game requirement to have the birds roaming in each of the Wild Areas.</li>
  <li>Unlock a fly point in each of the areas. Snowslide Slope (Articuno) East Lake Axewell (Zapdos) Fields of honor (Moltres) are recommended.</li>
  <li>Press the Home button on your controller, click <code>Connect</code> on the main window of the tool.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Time to get to work!</span></h3>
The goal is to fly into the location of our desired bird on the calculated target frame given by the generator. The advancement methods used are listed on the main page of this guide, <u>day skip</u>, <u>menuing</u> and <u>fly</u> advances will be used for this example.<br /><br />

If you plan to use the <code>DaySkip</code> feature you should take note of how many frames advance per day skipped to make sure you don't overshoot your target.<br /><br />

The delay for each of the birds varies. It's recommended to take a few practice attempts and note down your delay for the highest chances of being able to hit the target frame. See the <code>Troubleshooting Encounters</code> section at the bottom of this page if you are running into problems with delay calculation.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold" style="color:#C1A9CA;">Articuno</span><br />
<span class="fw-bold">Location:</span> Crown Tundra<br />
<span class="fw-bold">Recommended fly point:</span> Snowslide Slope<br />
<span class="fw-bold">Recommended starting delay:</span> 130-140<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold" style="color:#E76236;">Zapdos</span><br />
<span class="fw-bold">Location:</span> Wild Area (Meetup Point/Motostoke Area)<br />
<span class="fw-bold">Recommended fly point:</span> East Lake Axewell<br />
<span class="fw-bold">Recommended starting delay:</span> 20-30<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold" style="color:#DE2B5C;">Moltres</span><br />
<span class="fw-bold">Location:</span> Isle of Armor<br />
<span class="fw-bold">Recommended fly point:</span> Master Dojo<br />
<span class="fw-bold">Recommended starting delay:</span> 60-80<br /><br />

We will be aiming for any marked Zapdos for this example. You can be more specific with the filters if you wish, such as filtering for a specific mark or specific IVs. The process for RNG abusing each of the birds is the same.</span> You will simply fly to the correct location depending on which of the birds you are hunting.<br /><br />

These legendaries are shiny locked! The <code>Shiny Locked</code> box is checked before beginning to search.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 1 -</span> Tool setup<br />

<span class="fw-bold">Awesome, everything looks good!</span> Time to set the weather condition to clear/sunny.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 2 -</span> Game setup<br />

<u>These three fly points are suggested as they're close to the spawn point of each of the birds, meaning we can encounter them more quickly.</u><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 3 -</span> Recommended Fly Points<br />
<img src="./images/galar-bird-trio/figure-3-fly-points.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br />

Once the main window is filled in correctly you can begin looking for target frames by clicking the search button on the generator.<br /><br />

<u>If your results are not desirable, repeat the following:</u>
<ol>
  <li>Disconnect your Switch from the tool.</li>
  <li>Restart your game and enter the overworld.</li>
  <li>Enter the pause or Home menu and reconnect your Switch to the tool.</li>
  <li>Search again, do this until you have desirable results.</li>
</ol>

<span class="fw-bold">We found one!</span> A marked Zapdos-Galar in a cluster on advances x-y. These are the target frames for this example and we'll be flying to our desired location on any of these frames.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure  4 -</span> Target found!<br />
<img src="./images/galar-bird-trio/figure-4.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

It's common to see clusters when searching for a target, a cluster is a group of target frames that all end with the same result. It's a good idea to aim for large clusters of shiny frames when you put this guide into practice. The more duplicates in the cluster the more chances we will have at hitting our target Pokémon.<br /><br />

Now advance the RNG state while watching the <code>Curr adv.</code> box, we'll want to open our menu as close to the target frame as possible. Using Zapdos as our example...<br /><br />
<ul>
  <li>The target is on x-x advances away, based on previous recorded attempts the delay is y.</li>
  <li>Subtract the delay from the number of advances, this will be the target frame for this attempt.</li>
  <li>Advance towards the target frame using bike advances to slowly get closer to the target frame. (Use DaySkip to advance large distances quickly!)</li>
  <li>Once we are close enough, open the pause menu and select the map.</li>
  <li>If you are not on your target frame, open and close the map until you are close enough.</li>
  <li>Fly into the area the bird is in and track it down!</li>
</ul>
  
Opening the map will cause the RNG state to advance a small amount, the amount will vary depending on your current location, eivronment, and <span class="fw-bold">the amount of Pokemon currently on your party.</span> It's suggested to deposit all but one of your Pokemon into the PC to utilize this advancement method.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure  5 -</span> Target Frame Hit!<br />
<img src="./images/galar-bird-trio/figure-5.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">We hit our target frame!</span> If you believe you flew into position on the correct frame, chase down the bird and initiate the encounter, once you are in-battle use the <code>Read Encounter</code> feature of the generator to confirm the Pokémon you are in battle with matches the output of the generator.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 6/7/8 -</span> Result Found!<br />

The Zapdos matches the output of the generator, mission accomplished! Espeon in party slot 1 with the ability Syncronize was used to determine the nature, using a Pokémon with this ability will make the nature of any overworld Pokémon match the nature of yours.<br /><br />

Different areas & environments can have a drastic influence on delay, if you are missing targets when you believe you should be finding results, you should consider reading the <code>Troubleshooting Encounters</code> section down below.<br /><br />

<div class="bg-secondary title">
  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Troubleshooting Encounters</h1>

<hr />

This section covers how to troubleshoot encounters and delays. If you keep missing targets or can't find your result on the RNG tool, this is the place to be.<br /><br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Missing Targets:</span></h3>
<u>The commonly occuring reasons for missing a target Pokémon are:</u>
<ul>
  <li>Encounter spawned too late due to mistiming or bad luck.</li>
  <li>There is a amount delay left unaccounted for.</li>
  <li>Information in the main window was not completely accurate.</li>
</ul>

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Encounter did not spawn or spawned too late...</span></h5>

This is a common issue players will face when tackling this hunt as the delay is variable and not always consistent. Retry and search for a new target frame, take note of your delays on each attempt and go for the one you are hitting most often.<br /><br />

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Troubleshooting delay...</span></h5>

Each bird has a different delay which need calculating independently. Your delay is calculated by <code>frame hit - Frame initated = delay</code>. We can use the <code>Read Encounter</code> feature of the tool to confirm the frame we are hitting and see if we need to account for any delay. Here's how it's done!
<ul>
  <li>Aim for a target, such as any marked bird.</li>
  <li>Take a practice attempt and fly into the target. Take note of the frame you the Pokémon was spawned on.</li>
  <li>Encounter the Pokémon and click the <code>Read Encounter</code> button if you didn't find the Pokémon what you expected.</li>
  <li>Do a filterless search (or search for the specific IVs of the result you found) and find the frame you hit, take note of the number and subtract the target frame number from it.</li>
  <li>This will be your delay for that particular encounter.</li>
</ul>

Once you have noted down a few delays aim for targets once again, this time factoring in the delay you noted down. For example if we hit a delay of 30, our final A press will be 30 frames before the result you can see on the generator.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 9 -</span> Delay troubleshooting example<br />
<img src="./images/galar-bird-trio/figure-9-troubleshooting-encounters.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

We encountered an Zapdos, but it wasn't the one we desired! So what happened here? Well... We miscalculated. Let's try to find the frame we actually hit.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 10 -</span> Finding the frame<br />
<img src="./images/galar-bird-trio/figure-10-locating-frame.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

By filtering for IVs we can see the frame that generated the Zapdos. The frame we hit was 1-2 frames behind where we wanted to be, oh well! We will adjust accordingly for next time by flying into position 1-2 frames later.<br /><br />

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Cannot find result...</span></h5>
If you cannot find the Pokémon you are in battle with anywhere on the tool this is likely due to one of two reasons:
<ul>
  <li>Losing track of advancements.</li>
  <li>The information entered into the main window of the tool was not completely accurate.</li>
</ul>

Double check the information on the main tab is entered correctly by searching it on the Encounter Lookup and clicking the correct row. <u>You must pay attention to the row you are clicking and making sure it matches your in-game environment.</u><br /><br />

That's all there is to it!<br /><br />
