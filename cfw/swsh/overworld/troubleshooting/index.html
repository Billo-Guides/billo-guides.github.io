This section covers how to troubleshoot encounters and delays. If you keep missing targets, spawning in the wrong Pokémon, or can't find your result on the RNG tool, this is the place to be.<br /><br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Missing Targets:</span></h3>
<u>The commonly occuring reasons for missing a target Pokémon are:</u>
<ul>
  <li>Encounter spawned too late or too early due to mistiming.</li>
  <li>There is a delay left unaccounted for.</li>
  <li>Information in the main window was not completely accurate.</li>
</ul>

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Encounter spawned too late or too early...</span></h5>

This is a common issue players will face and is likely due to mistiming when spawning the Pokémon. Retry and search for a new target frame and make sure your player positioning is correct.<br /><br />

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Troubleshooting delay...</span></h5>

For the purposes of this guide, the term "delay" is used to describe the frame difference between the Pokémon we encountered and the frame the encounter was initiated on.<br /><br />

  <details>
    <summary><u>How to calculate delays:</u><br /></summary>
    <ol>
      <li>Aim for a target, such as any shiny Pokémon.</li>
      <li>Run towards the Pokémon and spawn it in the overworld then initiate the encounter. Take note of the frame the Pokémon was spawned on.</li>
      <li>Encounter the Pokémon and click the <code>Read Encounter</code> button.</li>
      <li>If you didn't find the Pokémon that you expected, do a filterless search (or search for the specific IVs of the result you found) and find the frame you hit.</li>
      <li>Subtract your target advancement from the frame you actually hit.</li>
      <li>This will be your delay for that particular encounter.</li>
    </ol>
    </details>
    <br />

Delay calculation mostly applies to encounters in extreme weather conditions or in an otherwise unstable environment, like having other spawned Pokémon present. Symbol and Hidden encounters also need to account for delay in order to hit a target frame.<br /><br />

<u>When RNG abusing in unstable conditions you should record delays for multiple attempts before aiming for a target and check for any consistent delay counts. It is also advised to aim for large clusters where possible to increase your chances of
  actually hitting the target.</u><br /><br />

We encountered an Duraludon, but it wasn't shiny! So what happened here? Well... We miscalculated. Let's try to find the frame we actually hit.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 9 -</span> Finding the frame<br />
<img src="./images/static/figure-9-locating-frame.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

By doing a filterless search we can see the the shiny cluster, and frame we hit was 2 frames behind where we wanted to be, oh well! We will adjust accordingly for next time by spawning it in the overworld 2 frames later.<br /><br />

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Cannot find result...</span></h5>
If you cannot find the Pokémon you are in battle with anywhere on the tool this is likely due to one of two reasons:
<ul>
  <li>Player was positioned too close to the spawn/grass and the encounter had already been generated long before we needed.</li>
  <li>The information entered into the main window of the tool was not completely accurate.</li>
</ul>

Try to reposition your character and see if your issue persists, if you are still having problems double check the information on the main tab is entered correctly by searching it on the <code>Encounter Lookup</code> and clicking the correct
row.<br /><br />

<u>You must pay attention to the row you are clicking and making sure it matches your in-game environment.</u><br /><br />

That's all there is to it!<br /><br />
