<hr />

If you made it this far, it must mean you have an interest in RNG abusing a Pokémon from a hidden encounter! This page will cover the whole process, from finding a desirable location to achieving a final result.<br /> <br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Getting Started:</span></h3>
<u>Before starting, do the following:</u>
<ul>
  <li>Find a hidden encounter in an ideal location and weather condition using the <code>Encounter Lookup</code> tab of the RNG tool.</li>
  <li>Click on the row you prefer, this will enter all the information you need into the main window automatically.</li>
  <li>Head to the location in-game and stand directly next to to a patch of grass in the area, ideally with minimal NPCs or other spawned Pokémon present.</li>
  <li>Save the game, then press the Home button on your controller, click <code>Connect</code> on the main window of the tool.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Time to get to work!</span></h3>
The goal is to walk into grass and spawn a hidden encounter on the calculated target frame given by the generator. The advancement methods used are listed on the main page of this guide, <u>day skip</u>, <u>bike</u> and <u>player movement</u> advances will be used for this example.<br /><br />

If you plan to use the <code>DaySkip</code> feature you should take note of how many frames advance per day skipped to make sure you don't overshoot your target.<br /><br />

We will be aiming for a Shiny Sinistea-Antique in Glimwood Tangle. You can be more specific with the filters if you wish, such as filtering for a specific mark or specific IVs.<br /><br />

<u>Using Sinistea-Antique as the example:</u><br />
- The <code>Encounter Lookup</code> tab tells us that Sinistea-Antique in Glimwood Tangle has an encounter slot range of 99-99, a level range of 34-36 and is a hidden encounter in all weather. It also tells us Sinistea-Antique does not hold a random item and has no potential Egg Moves.<br />
- Number of KOs is irrelevant as hidden encounters cannot be Brilliant Aura.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Let's enter this information into the main window by clicking the row that matches our conditions!</span><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 1 -</span> Tool setup<br />

<span class="fw-bold">Awesome, everything looks good!</span> Time to find an ideal position to stand in-game.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 2 -</span> Game setup<br />
<img src="./images/hidden/figure-2-in-game-setup.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<u>This location in Glimwood Tangle is ideal, there are no NPCs around and has no extra unwanted spawns. The same rules apply for other areas.</u><br /><br />

Once the main window is filled in correctly & you are stood in a good position in-game, you can begin looking for target frames by clicking the search button on the generator.<br /><br />

<u>If your results are not desirable, repeat the following:</u>
<ol>
  <li>Disconnect your Switch from the tool.</li>
  <li>Restart your game and enter the overworld.</li>
  <li>Enter the pause or Home menu and reconnect your Switch to the tool.</li>
  <li>Search again, do this until you have desirable results.</li>
</ol>

<span class="fw-bold">We found one!</span> A shiny, gentle natured Sinistea-Antique in a cluster on advances 19,139 and 19,141. These are the target frames for this example and we'll be walking into the grass to spawn our encounter with Sinistea on any of these frames.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 3 -</span> Target found!<br />
<img src="./images/hidden/figure-3-target-found-hidden.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

It's common to see clusters of shiny frames when searching for a target, a cluster is a group of target frames that all end with the same result. It's a good idea to aim for large clusters of shiny frames when you put this guide into practice. The more duplicates in the cluster the more chances we will have at hitting our target Pokémon.<br /><br />

Advance the RNG state while watching the <code>Curr adv.</code> box, take 1-2 steps into the grass when you see your target number on-screen.<br /><br />

Hidden encounters have a chance of spawning per step taken while in grass. If the encounter does not spawn in the first 1-2 steps there is a good chance that you will miss your target frame.<br /><br />

Glimwood Tangle has a base delay of 5~. This means our target frames for this example will be advances 19,135-19,137. You can find out how to calculate delay at the bottom of this page in the Troubleshooting Encounters section.<br /><br /> 

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 4 -</span> Target frame hit!<br />
<img src="./images/hidden/figure-4-hitting-target-hidden.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">We hit our target frame!</span> If you believe you spawned the Pokémon on the correct frame, run towards the it and initiate the encounter, once you are in-battle use the <code>Read Encounter</code> feature to confirm the Pokémon you are in battle with matches the output of the generator.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 5/6/7 -</span> Result found!<br />

The Sinistea-Antique matches the output of the tool, mission accomplished! A Pokémon in party slot 1 with the ability Syncronize was used to determine the nature, using a Pokémon with this ability will make the nature of any overworld Pokémon match the nature of yours.<br /><br />

You can find video examples of initiating the encounter and capture <a href="https://imgur.com/a/kIkeAPt">here</a>.<br /><br />

Different areas & environments can have a drastic influence on delay, if you are missing targets when you believe you should be finding results, you should consider reading the Troubleshooting Encounters section down below.<br /><br />

  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Troubleshooting Encounters</h1>

<hr />

This section covers how to troubleshoot encounters and delays. If you miss a target, spawning in the wrong Pokemon, or can't find your result on the RNG tool, this is the place to be.<br /><br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Missing Targets:</span></h3>
The commonly occuring reasons for missing a target Pokémon are:
<ul>
  <li>Encounter did not spawn.</li>
  <li>Encounter spawned too late due to mistiming.</li>
  <li>There is a delay left unaccounted for.</li>
  <li>Frame was "hit" but an incorrect species of Pokémon was encountered.</li>
  <li>Information in the main window was not completely accurate.</li>
</ul>

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Encounter did not spawn or spawned too late...</span></h5>

This is a common issue players will face when tackling hidden encounters. Simply retry and search for a new target frame and make sure your player positioning is correct. Standing directly next to the grass is advised as you will be able to spawn a hidden encounter in 1-2 steps. You will know if you are standing too close when the player starts the crouching animation, this is something we want to avoid as it messes with player movement.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 8 -</span> Crouching animation<br />

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Troubleshooting delay...</span></h5>

Most hidden encounters have a small base delay at minimum (normally ~3). This mostly applies to encounters in extreme weather conditions or in an otherwise unstable environment, like having other spawned Pokémon present. Your delay is calculated by <code>frame hit - Frame initated = delay</code>. We can use the <code>Read Encounter</code> feature of the tool to confirm the frame we are hitting and see if we need to account for any delay. Here's how it's done!
<ul>
  <li>Aim for a target, such as any shiny Pokemon.</li>
  <li>Walk into the grass and initiate an encounter. Take note of the frame you decide to walk into the grass on.</li>
  <li>Encounter the Pokemon and click the <code>Read Encounter</code> button if you didn't find the Pokemon what you expected.</li>
  <li>Do a filterless search and find the frame you hit, take note of the number and subtract the target frame number from it.</li>
  <li>This will be your delay for that particular encounter.</li>
</ul>

<u>When RNG abusing in unstable conditions you should record delays for multiple attempts before aiming for a target and check for any consistent delay counts. It is also advised to aim for large clusters where possible to increase your chances of actually hitting the target.</u><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 9 -</span> Delay troubleshooting example<br />
<img src="./images/hidden/figure-9-troubleshooting-delay.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

We hit a shiny, but it wasn't Sinistea-Antique! So what happened here? We actually hit a different frame within a shiny cluster which contained the encounter slot values for Morgrem, we can take a look by locating the exact PokemonHere encounter in the <code>Encounter Lookup</code> tab and clicking search again on the main window. <br /><br />

<u>If the Pokemon you find is non shiny you will need to be more specific with your filters, include the exact IVs displayed in the <code>Read Encounter</code> box to easily find the frame that you hit.</u><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 10 -</span> Troubleshooting Encounter-slots<br />
<img src="./images/hidden/figure-10-encounter-lookup-troubleshooting-morgrem.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

Here we can see Morgrem was indeed a shiny Pokémon within the cluster (Encounterslot value of 0-19 according to <code>Encounter Lookup</code>). Our goal was frame 3,996 and we hit frame 4005, the tool shows these values are a match 9 frames later than our desired target frame, we will adjust accordingly by walking into the grass 9~ frames earlier next time.<br /><br />

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Cannot find result...</span></h5>
If you cannot find the Pokémon you are in battle with anywhere on the tool this is likely due to one of two reasons:
<ul>
  <li>Player was positioned too close to the spawn and the Pokémon had already been generated long before walking into it.</li>
  <li>The shaky grass spawned too late and you missed your target frame as a result.</li>
  <li>The information entered into the main window of the tool was not completely accurate.</li>
</ul>

Try to reposition your character and see if your issue persists, if you are still having problems double check the information on the main window is entered correctly by searching it on the Encounter Lookup and clicking the correct row. <u>You must pay attention to the row you are clicking and making sure it matches your in-game environment.</u><br /><br />

That's all there is to it!<br /><br />
