<hr />

If you made it this far, it must mean you have an interest in RNG abusing Pokémon from hidden encounters! This page will cover the whole process, from finding a desirable location to achieving a final result.<br /> <br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Getting Started:</span></h3>
<u>Before starting, do the following:</u>
<ul>
  <li>Open the GUI and click on the <code>Encounter Lookup</code> button at the top of the main window. This will open the Encounter Lookup tab.</li>
  <li>Type the species name of the Pokémon you are hunting into the empty field, this will bring up a list of every possible encounter and has all the information you need for the main window.</li>
  <li>Scroll down the list of encounters and click on one of the rows displaying a hidden encounter, this will automatically enter the information into the main window.</li>
  <li>Head to the location in-game and stand 1-2 steps away from a patch of grass in the area and save the game.</li>
  <li>Press the Home button on your controller, click <code>Connect</code> on the main window of the tool.</li>
</ul>

When searching possible encounters it is suggested to pick an encounter in a quiet area with calm weather to reduce the amount of noise significantly. Noise is area specific, to test how much noise an area has, head to the location in-game and connect your console to the GUI while standing in the overworld and monitor the speed of advancements.<br /> <br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Time to get to work!</span></h3>
The goal is to walk into grass and spawn a hidden encounter on the calculated target frame given by the generator. The advancement methods used are listed on the main page of this guide, <u>day skip</u>, <u>bike</u> and <u>player movement</u> advances will be used for this example.<br /><br />

If you plan to use the <code>DaySkip</code> feature you should take a moment to monitor your advances to avoid overshooting. Connect to the GUI and skip 1 day at a time to get a rough estimate amount of advances per day skipped.<br /><br />

We will be aiming for a Shiny Sinistea-Antique in Glimwood Tangle. You can be more specific with the filters if you wish, such as filtering for a specific mark or specific IVs.<br /><br />

<u>Using Sinistea-Antique as the example:</u><br />
- The <code>Encounter Lookup</code> tab tells us that Sinistea-Antique in Glimwood Tangle has an encounter slot range of 99-99, a level range of 34-36 and is a hidden encounter in all weather. It also tells us Sinistea-Antique does not hold a random item and has no potential Egg Moves.<br />
- Clicking the row that applies to our encounter will enter all the information we need into the main window.<br />
- Number of KOs is irrelevant as hidden encounters cannot be Brilliant Aura.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Let's enter this information into the main window by clicking the row that matches our conditions!</span><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 1 -</span> Tool setup<br />
<img src="./images/hidden/figure-1-encounter-lookup-symbol-sinistea-antique.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Awesome, everything looks good!</span> Time to find an ideal position to stand in-game.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 2 -</span> Game setup<br />
<img src="./images/hidden/figure-2-in-game-setup.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<u>This location in Glimwood Tangle is ideal, there are no NPCs around and has no extra unwanted spawns present.</u> Glimwood tangle is a moderately noisy area so the less extra noise, the better. This rule applies for all other areas.<br /><br />

Once the main window is filled in correctly & you are stood in a good position in-game, you can begin looking for target frames by clicking the search button on the generator.<br /><br />

<u>If your results are not desirable, repeat the following:</u>
<ol>
  <li>Disconnect your Switch from the tool.</li>
  <li>Restart your game and enter the overworld.</li>
  <li>Enter the pause or Home menu and reconnect your Switch to the tool.</li>
  <li>Search again, do this until you have desirable results.</li>
</ol>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 3 -</span> Target found!<br />
<img src="./images/hidden/figure-3-target-found-hidden.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">We found one!</span> A shiny, gentle natured Sinistea-Antique in a cluster on advances 19,139 and 19,141. These are the "target frames" and the aim will be to spawn a hidden encounter in the grass on either of these frames.<br /><br />

Hidden encounters have a chance of spawning per step taken while in grass. If the encounter does not spawn in the first 1-2 steps there is a good chance that you will miss your target frame.<br /><br />

Once a hidden encounter is spawned the stats and internal details (such as PID/EC) are generated and set in stone, this is why it is only important to spawn the encounter on the correct frame. <span class="fw-bold">Don't let the Pokémon despawn after you spawn it in the overworld!</span> Hidden encounters will despawn within a few seconds of appearing, run into the encounter quickly.<br /><br />

It's common to see "clusters" or "groups" of frames that produce the same result when searching for a target. Aiming for large clusters is recommended as this will provide more chances for the player to spawn the Pokémon on the correct frame.<br /><br />

<u>Advancing towards the target (Step-by-step example):</u><br />
<ul>
  <li>The target is 19,139 and 19,141 advances away, the delay is 5 in Glimwood Tangle based on local testing, this means the target frames for this attempt are frame 19,134 and 19,147.</li>
  <li>Stand close to a patch of grass in the area, advance towards the target frame using bike or using spawned overworld Pokémon in the area. You can use DaySkip to advance large distances quickly too!</li>
  <li>Once close enough (within ~1000 frames), stand near to the patch of grass, ideally with minimal spawned Pokémon in the grass.</li>
  <li>From this point it's recommended to only advance by opening and closing the menu and using player movement/bike advancements.</li>
  <li>Open and close the pause menu with X, take note of how many the number of advancements that have passed from doing so. Repeat this process a few times and then take the highest number of advances from your results.</li>
  <li>Advance closer to your target (within ~100 frames) and pause the game by pressing X.</li>
  <li>Use animation advances to get close towards your target frame, factor in the number of advances that pass from closing the menu. (For example: We get 5 advances from closing the menu and our target is 50 advances away, only 45 animation advances will be required as we'd pick up the remaining 5 from closing the pause menu.)</li>
  <li>Close the menu and run into the grass to spawn the encounter, player movement advancements will not occur until the control stick is in a resting state. This gives the best chance at spawning the encounter on the correct frame.</li>
</ul>

You can be creative with the methods you use to advance the RNG state.<br /><br />

You can find out how to calculate delay at the bottom of this page in the Troubleshooting Encounters section.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">We hit our target frame!</span> If you believe you spawned the Pokemon on the correct frame, run towards the it quickly and initiate the encounter before it despawns, once you are in-battle use the <code>Read Encounter</code> feature to confirm the Pokémon you are in battle with matches the output of the generator.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 5/6/7 -</span> Result found!<br />

The Sinistea-Antique matches the output of the tool, mission accomplished! A Pokémon in party slot 1 with the ability Syncronize was used to determine the nature, using a Pokémon with this ability will make the nature of any overworld Pokémon match the nature of yours.<br /><br />

You can find video examples of initiating the encounter and capture <a href="https://imgur.com/a/kIkeAPt">here</a>.<br /><br />

Different areas & environments can have a drastic influence on delay, if you are missing targets when you believe you should be finding results, you should consider reading the Troubleshooting Encounters section down below.<br /><br />

  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Troubleshooting Encounters</h1>

<hr />

This section covers how to troubleshoot encounters and delays. If you miss a target, spawning in the wrong Pokemon, or can't find your result on the RNG tool, this is the place to be.<br /><br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Missing Targets:</span></h3>
The commonly occuring reasons for missing a target Pokémon are:
<ul>
  <li>Encounter did not spawn.</li>
  <li>Encounter spawned too late due to mistiming.</li>
  <li>There is a delay left unaccounted for.</li>
  <li>Frame was "hit" but an incorrect species of Pokémon was encountered.</li>
  <li>Information in the main window was not completely accurate.</li>
</ul>

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Encounter did not spawn or spawned too late...</span></h5>

This is a common issue players will face when tackling hidden encounters and is likely due to mistiming when spawning the Pokémon. Retry and search for a new target frame and make sure your player positioning is correct.<br /><br /> 

Standing directly next to the grass is advised as you will be able to spawn a hidden encounter in 1-2 steps. You will know if you are standing too close when the player starts the crouching animation, this is something we want to avoid.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 8 -</span> Crouching animation<br />

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Troubleshooting delay...</span></h5>

For the purposes of this guide, the term "delay" is used to describe the frame difference between the Pokemon we encountered and the frame the encounter was initiated on.<br /><br />

Most hidden encounters need to account for some amount of delay, this applies most to encounters in extreme weather conditions or in an otherwise unstable environment, like having other spawned Pokémon present.<br /><br />

Delay Calc - <code>frame Pokemon was generated - frame encounter was initiated = delay</code><br /><br />

We can use the <code>Read Encounter</code> feature of the tool to confirm the exact frame the encounter was generated on and calculate the delay from there. Here's how it's done!
<ul>
  <li>Aim for a target, such as any shiny Pokémon.</li>
  <li>Walk towards the grass, spawn the Pokemon and initiate an encounter. Take note of the frame you the Pokémon was spawned on.</li>
  <li>Encounter the Pokémon and click the <code>Read Encounter</code> button.</li>
  <li>If you didn't find the Pokémon that you expected, do a filterless search (or search for the specific IVs of the result you found) and find the frame you hit.</li>
  <li>Subtract your target advancement from the frame you actually hit.</li>
  <li>This will be your delay for that particular encounter.</li>
</ul>

<u>When RNG abusing in unstable conditions you should record delays for multiple attempts before aiming for a target and check for any consistent delay counts. It is also advised to aim for large clusters where possible to increase your chances of actually hitting the target.</u><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 9 -</span> Delay troubleshooting example<br />
<img src="./images/hidden/figure-9-troubleshooting-delay.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

We hit a shiny, but it wasn't Sinistea-Antique! So what happened here? We actually hit a different frame within a shiny cluster which contained the encounter slot values for Morgrem, we can take a look by locating the exact encounter in the <code>Encounter Lookup</code> tab and clicking search again on the main window. <br /><br />

<u>If the Pokemon you find is non shiny you will need to be more specific with your filters, include the exact IVs displayed in the <code>Read Encounter</code> box to easily find the frame that you hit.</u><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 10 -</span> Troubleshooting Encounter-slots<br />
<img src="./images/hidden/figure-10-encounter-lookup-troubleshooting-morgrem.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

Here we can see Morgrem was indeed a shiny Pokémon within the cluster (Encounterslot value of 0-19 according to <code>Encounter Lookup</code>). Our goal was frame 3,996 and we hit frame 4005, the tool shows these values are a match 9 frames later than our desired target frame, we will adjust accordingly by walking into the grass 9~ frames earlier next time.<br /><br />

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Cannot find result...</span></h5>
If you cannot find the Pokémon you are in battle with anywhere on the tool this is likely due to one of two reasons:
<ul>
  <li>The encounter spawned too late and you missed your target frame as a result.</li>
  <li>The information entered into the main window of the tool was not completely accurate.</li>
</ul>

Try to reposition your character and see if your issue persists, if you are still having problems double check the information on the main window is entered correctly by searching it on the Encounter Lookup and clicking the correct row. <u>You must pay attention to the row you are clicking and making sure it matches your in-game environment.</u><br /><br />

That's all there is to it!<br /><br />
