<p>This page provides information and worked examples for how you can RNG abuse Pokémon from <span class="fw-bold">Hidden encounters.</span> The whole process will be covered here, from finding a desirable location to use to achieving the final result.</p>

<p>Hidden encounters are not guaranteed to be the same species every time, the Pokémon species is instead based on an encounterslot value of 0-99. The encounterslot values will change with the weather, the weather can potentially change every time the clock hits 00:00.</p>

  <p><span class="fw-bold">Using Sinistea-Antique as the example:</span> The location for this encounter given by Encounter Lookup is Glimwood Tangle, the weather in this area does not change. The search filters have also been set to search for any Shiny with any Mark.</p>

    <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">The Process</h1>
   </div><hr />

   <p>The goal is to walk into the grass on calculated target frame displayed by the generator search results. Once a hidden has spawned in the overworld the stats and internal details are set in stone, hidden encounters will disappear rapidly so encounter the Pokémon quickly!</p>
    
   <p>From here the it is assumed that your encounter & search filters have been properly configured (see Figure 1). The advancement methods used are throughout this guide are listed inside the table found on the main page.</p>

  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>For Hidden encounters, the best place to stand would be directly next to a patch of grass in the area. The smaller the patch, the better as this will reduce the amount of spawned overworld Pokemon.</p>

    <p>The above location is ideal, there are a low number of NPCs in the area, the grass patch is small, and there are no extra overworld Pokémon present.</p>

    <p>If you are hunting for hidden encounters in other areas, you may notice that it is impossible to find a patch of grass with no overworld spawns. This will reduce the effectiveness of closing the pause menu to freeze the RNG state.</p>

    <blockquote>If you cannot find a good position to stand in, you can knock out any static spawns that block your path to the Pokémon, it will remain despawned until return to the area after a date has been changed.</blockquote>

<img src="./images/hidden/figure-3-target-found-hidden.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<p>We found one! After searching for a desirable result we can see a shiny, Gentle natured Sinistea-Antique in a cluster on advances 19,139 and 19,141. When searching for target frames you may notice that they appear in clusters, clusters are a group of frames that produce the same end result. The larger the cluster, the better chances you have of hitting your target frame!</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold">It's time to begin advancing towards the target frame!</span></p>

<hr /><div class="title" style="background-color: #0c0038;">
  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Advancing Towards the Target!</h1>
</div><hr />

<p>After setting up your search filters and standing in the correct position in-game, you will need to calculate the amount of NPCs in the area and the base delay of the encounter. Doing both of these things will provide the best possible chances of hitting the correct target frame.</p>

  <div class="anchored card-header" style="background-color: #0c0038;" id="delay-npc-count-symbol-cfw">
    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Delay Calculation & NPC Calibration:</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <h6 span class="fw-bold">Delay Calculation</h6>
    <ol>
      <li>Aim for a target frame, such as any shiny Pokémon.</li>
      <li>Spawn the Pokémon on the desired target frame, then initiate the encounter.</li>
      <li>Take note of the frame that you believe the Pokémon was spawned on.</li>
      <li>Read the Pokémon you are in battle with using the <code class="fw-bold">Read Encounter</code> button.</li>
      <li>If this is the Pokémon you expected, your delay will be 0.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, perform a filterless search to find the Pokémon you hit.</li>
      <li>Subtract the frame the Pokémon was spawned on from the frame you actually hit.</li>
      <li>This will be your delay for that particular encounter.</li>
    </ol>

    <blockquote>Hidden encounters have the chance to spawn per step taken in grass, they may not spawn quickly enough which means you will miss your target as a result. Spawn the encounter within 1-3 steps when calculating delay for the most accurate results.</blockquote>

    <h6 span class="fw-bold">NPC Calibration</h6>
    <ol>
      <li>Pause the game then disconnect and reconnect to the program, if done correctly, the number inside the <code span class="fw-bold">Curr. Adv</code> field of the main window should now be 0.</li>
      <li>Click the <code span class="fw-bold">Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> button at the top of the main window to open the tab. Your seeds should be visible in the correct fields automatically.</li>
      <li>Close the pause menu then quickly re-open it, note of the number of advancements that have occured from doing so (see <code span class="fw-bold">Curr. Adv</code>).</li>  
      <li>Type 0 into the <code span class="fw-bold">NPCs</code> field and search. Gradually increase by 1 until the number inside the top row of the <code span class="fw-bold">Jump</code> column matches the number inside the <code span class="fw-bold">Curr. Adv</code> field.</li>
      <li>Close and re-open the pause menu a few times to make sure that the calculated NPC count is correct.</li>
    </ol>

  </div>
  </div><br>

  <p>Take note of the calculated delay and NPC count, you will need this information in order to reach the correct target frame later. Do not change position after calculating the number of NPCs, as this is subject to change depending on positioning.</p>

      <h6 class="fw-bold">Step-by-step tutorial:</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Advance towards your target frame using any of the methods listed inside the table on the <a href="https://billo-guides.github.io/cfw/swsh/overworld">main page</a>. Consider date skipping to advance large distances.</li><p></p>
        <li>Once you are close a few thousand frames away from the target, head back to the correct position in-game (see Figure 2).</li><p></p>
        <li>Pause the game, then disconnect and reconnect to the Main Window and press the search button again. This will be the new target frame.</li><p></p>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>From this point it is recommended to advance towards the target using only menu close prediction & animation advancements. These methods advance frames in small increments, making them easy to keep track of.</blockquote>

      <ul>
        <li>Open the Menu Close Advances Viewer tab, and type the calculated number of NPCs into the <code span class="fw-bold">NPCs</code> field.</li><p></p>
        <li>Then type your target frame into the <code span class="fw-bold">+</code> field and search, factor in the delay that was calculated earlier (Example: <code span class="fw-bold">1000 (target) - 3 (delay) = 997 (new target)</code>).</li><p></p>
      </ul>

       <blockquote>If you are unable to find your target frame in the search results, use animations to advance the RNG state by 1, repeat until your target frame is visible inside the Menu Close Advances Viewer window.<br><br>

       If you cannot hit your target frame using menu close prediction, use it to get as close as you can. Afterwards you can use an alternative advancement method (e.g player movement) to hit your target frame.</blockquote>

      <ul>
        <li>Open and close the pause menu until closing the menu a single time lands onto your target frame, according to the <code span class="fw-bold">Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> prediction.</li><p></p>
        <li>Close the pause menu and quickly run into the grass to try to spawn an encounter, then initate the encounter! Confirm you have hit the expected result by clicking the <code span class="fw-bold">Read Encounter</code> button when in battle.</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>If you encountered an unexpected result, this either means you missed your target frame (too slow), the encounter did not spawn on time, or your delay is incorrect. Confirm your delay using the <a href="#delay-npc-count-symbol-cfw">above mentioned method</a> and retry.</blockquote>

<p>Keep in mind that spawning a hidden encounter is subject to random chance, sometimes the encounter may spawn too late, which will result in missing the target frame. Be prepared to make multiple attempts for this encounter type.</p>
