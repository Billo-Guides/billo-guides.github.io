        <h6 span class="fw-bold">What Are Rain Ticks?</h6>
        <p>Rain Ticks refer to the RNG advances that occur when Rain or Thunderstorm are the active weather condition. The advances are used to randomly place raindrops on screen. Despite the sheer speed of RNG advances caused by wet weather, the number of advances remains predictable through proper calibration. We will perform this calibration using the <code class="fw-bold">Advanced Settings</code> section in the main window.</p>

        <p>For accuracy and stability, calibrate your Rain Ticks using encounters that spawn in a single step. Each step taken in grass causes a specific number of Rain Ticks, which varies based on location. The number of steps required to trigger a Hidden encounter is listed in the <code span class="fw-bold">Step</code> column of the search result table.</p>

        <h6 span class="fw-bold">Rain Tick Calibration</h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Position yourself optimally (see Figure 2 for a visual demonstration), then change the weather to anything that is NOT Rain/Thunderstorm. Check the current weather on your map, then save and reboot the game.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Immediately open the in-game menu to pause the game once you enter the overworld. Calibrate your NPC count as usual. Stay within either the main pause menu or the Pok&eacute;mon party list once you are done calibrating. Close the <code class="fw-bold">MenuCloseTimeline</code> subwindow and verify that your NPC count has been entered into the main window.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li> Verify that both <code class="fw-bold">Consider Menu Close?</code> and <code class="fw-bold">Holding Direction?</code> are checked.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Place a Pok&eacute;mon with No Guard, Illuminate, or Arena Trap into the lead slot of your party.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Change the weather back to Rain or Thunderstorm. Verify this by opening the map. Save and reboot the game, and as before, pause the game by opening the menu immediately after entering the overworld.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>You should now have correct positioning, weather condition, calibrated NPC count, and a lead Pok&eacute;mon with an ability that boosts the likelihood of spawning a hidden encounter.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>On owoow, set your weather condition back to Rain/Thunderstorm.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>In the <code span class="fw-bold">Advanced Settings</code> section, check the <code span class="fw-bold">Raining/Thunderstorming?</code> checkboxes. For the calibration, set the <code span class="fw-bold">Rain Ticks</code> value to 0.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Open the Pok&eacute;mon party list and click <code class="fw-bold">Update Seeds</code> in owoow. This will set your current advances to 0 which is important for calibration purposes.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Back out of the Pok&eacute;mon party list to enter the main pause menu. Hold a direction on your joystick toward a clear path through the grass.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Unpause the game while holding a direction to hopefully trigger a hidden encounter.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>If an encounter was triggered, quickly initiate the encounter before it despawns. If your encounter does not spawn in a single step, did not spawn at all, or you were not able to run to it in time, reboot the game and try again.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Once the encounter is triggered, enter battle quickly before it despawns. While in battle, click the <code class="fw-bold">Read Encounter</code> button on owoow, then press <code class="fw-bold">Copy IVs to Filters</code>. Change the species inside the <code class="fw-bold">Encounter Settings</code> to match the Pok&eacute;mon you encountered if necessary.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Under <code span class="fw-bold">Advanced Settings</code>, click the <code span class="fw-bold">Calculate Rain Ticks</code> button. If you did this correctly, you should see a result pop up. Enter the calibrated value into the <code span class="fw-bold">Rain Ticks</code> field. You should expect to see a Rain Tick value of 20 or less in most cases.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The calibration fields (<code class="fw-bold">Consider Menu Close?</code> / <code class="fw-bold">Holding Direction?</code> / <code class="fw-bold">Rain Ticks</code>) account for the advances consumed when leaving the party list and closing the pause menu. Make sure you have the correct boxes checked; the search result table uses these checkboxes to calculate the exact frame on which to close the party list and spawn your target Pok&eacute;mon.</p>

    <span class="fw-bold">Troubleshooting -</span> If multiple possible results appear during calibration, repeat the process or adjust your position slightly until you find a consistent Rain Tick value. If you have highly variable Rain Tick values, this may be because you are spawning Pok&eacute;mon in different numbers of steps. Aim to calibrate on a Pok&eacute;mon generated in a single step.

        <span class="fw-bold text-light">Advancing Towards a Target</span>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>The recommended method for advancing the RNG state is to perform all advances in the pause menu. This can be done using <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/overworld/advancing-rng-state/wet-weather-menuing.gif">wet weather menuing</a> and <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/overworld/advancing-rng-state/animations.gif">attack animations</a>. These methods advance the RNG state slowly but offer the highest consistency between attempts.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The more time you spend on the overworld, the more inaccurate your previous calibration will be. This is because the spawned Pok&eacute;mon wander, which means they can despawn, run into you, or walk into a position that causes extra advances when you finally attempt the RNG manipulation. Spending even a few seconds in the overworld is enough to ruin your previous calibration efforts.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>If you freshly boot into the game while positioned in the grass and immediately open the in-game pause menu, the spawned overworld Pok&eacute;mon will not start moving for a while. You should always immediately pause the game if you reboot while searching for seeds.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Unfortunately, options for advancing with the menu open are limited and slow. It may be worth investing in a controller with turbo capabilities, or you can use automation methods to click through menus or trigger attack animations.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In this example, a shiny, Weather Mark Elekid appears in a {% include tooltips/clusters.html %} from advances 3,484-3,488. The calibrated NPC count is 4 and the current Rain Tick value is 20. Holding a direction when closing the pause menu is mandatory for Rain/Thunderstorm targets as this helps to keep the Rain Tick value as consistent as possible between attempts.</p>

        <h6 class="fw-bold">Step-by-Step</h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Ensure the <code class="fw-bold">Consider Menu Close?</code> and <code class="fw-bold">Holding Direction?</code> checkboxes are checked, and verify that your NPC count is calibrated correctly.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Advance towards your target using <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/overworld/advancing-rng-state/wet-weather-menuing.gif">wet weather menuing</a> or <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/overworld/advancing-rng-state/animations.gif">attack animations</a> until you are roughly 100-300 advances away. Open the Pok&eacute;mon party list.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Click <code class="fw-bold">Update Seeds</code> and search for your target again. <b>You should be on the Pok&eacute;mon party list, not a Pok&eacute;mon summary page!</b> Use <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/swsh/overworld/advancing-rng-state/animations.gif">attack animations</a> to reach your exact target frame.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>You are now ready to perform the hidden RNG manipulation. Back out to the main pause menu and hold a direction on the joystick toward your clear path in the grass.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Unpause the game by closing the menu. This will cause the player to take steps in the grass, triggering the hidden encounter. This should appear as a speech bubble with a red <code class="fw-bold">!</code>.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>If you planned to swap out your lead Pok&eacute;mon for a Synchronize lead, you can do so now if you open the pause menu right away.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Quickly initiate the encounter before it despawns and verify the result matches expectations. Spawned hidden encounters disappear within a few seconds.</li>
        </ol>
