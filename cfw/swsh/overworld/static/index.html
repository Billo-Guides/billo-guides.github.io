 </div><hr />

 <p>This page provides information and worked examples for how you can RNG abuse Pokémon from <span class="fw-bold">Static encounters.</span> The whole process will be covered here, from finding a desirable location to use to achieving the final result.</p>

 <p>Static spawners will contain the same species of Pokémon until the weather in the area changes. The weather can potentially change whenever the clock hits 00:00. Keep this in mind to avoid rolling incorrect weather during the session, as this can produce an unexpected Pokémon.</p>

  <p><span class="fw-bold">Using Duraludon as the example:</span> The location for this encounter given by Encounter Lookup is Giant's Seat, and the expected weather condition is Overcast. The search filters have been set to search for any Shiny with any Mark.</p>

  <p><span class="fw-bold">With all the setup instructions out of the way, let's get to work!</span></p>

 <hr /><div class="title" style="background-color: #0c0038;">
  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">The Process</h1>
 </div><hr />

  <p>The goal is to walk towards the spawn point of the encounter on the calculated target frame displayed on the by the generatpr search results. Once a Pokémon has spawned in the overworld the stats and internal details are set in stone.</p>
    
  <p>From here the it is assumed that your encounter & search filters have been properly configured (see Figure 1). The advancement methods used are throughout this guide are listed inside the table found on the main page.</p>

      <span class="fw-bold text-light">Game Setup:</span>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
      <p>For Static encounters, the best place to stand would be in an area which creates a clear, straight line between the player and the target Pokémon. Avoid standing in areas that trigger other wild Pokémon or Static encounters to spawn where possible.</p>

      <p>The above location is considered an ideal location, there are a low number of NPCs around and no extra spawned Pokémon present. There is also a clear line between the player and the target Pokémon.</p>

      <p>Giant's Seat is also located inside the base Wild Area, which is a notably quiet area in calm weather conditions, the speed of advancements will depend on your location, NPC count & weather.</p>

      <blockquote>If you cannot find a good position to stand in, you can knock out any static spawns that block your path to the Pokémon, it will remain despawned until return to the area after a date has been changed.</blockquote>

  <span class="fw-bold">Figure 3 -</span> Target found!<p></p>
  <img src="./images/static/figure-3-static-search-duraludon.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

  <p>We found one! After searching for a desirable result we can see a shiny, Adamant natured Duraludon in a cluster on advances 1000-1001. When searching for target frames you may notice that they appear in clusters, clusters are a group of frames that produce the same end result. The larger the cluster, the better chances you have of hitting your target frame!</p>
  
  <p><span class="fw-bold">It's time to begin advancing towards the target frame!</span></p>

  <hr /><div class="title" style="background-color: #0c0038;">
    <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Advancing Towards the Target!</h1>
  </div><hr />

  <p>After setting up your search filters and standing in the correct position in-game, you will need to calculate the amount of NPCs in the area and the base delay of the encounter. Doing both of these things will provide the best possible chances of hitting the correct target frame.</p>

      <span class="fw-bold text-light">Delay Calculation & NPC Calibration:</span>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
      <h6 span class="fw-bold">Delay Calculation</h6>
      <ol>
        <li>Aim for a target frame, such as any shiny Pokémon.</li>
        <li>Spawn the Pokémon on the desired target frame, then initiate the encounter.</li>
        <li>Take note of the frame that you believe the Pokémon was spawned on.</li>
        <li>Read the Pokémon you are in battle with using the <code class="fw-bold">Read Encounter</code> button.</li>
        <li>If this is the Pokémon you expected, your delay will be 0.</li>
        <li>Otherwise, perform a filterless search to find the Pokémon you hit.</li>
        <li>Subtract the frame the Pokémon was spawned on from the frame you actually hit.</li>
        <li>This will be your delay for that particular encounter.</li>
      </ol>

      <h6 span class="fw-bold">NPC Calibration</h6>
      <ol>
        <li>Pause the game then disconnect and reconnect to the program, if done correctly, the number inside the <code span class="fw-bold">Curr. Adv</code> field of the main window should now be 0.</li>
        <li>Click the <code span class="fw-bold">Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> button at the top of the main window to open the tab. Your seeds should be visible in the correct fields automatically.</li>
        <li>Close the pause menu then quickly re-open it, note of the number of advancements that have occured from doing so (see <code span class="fw-bold">Curr. Adv</code>).</li>  
        <li>Type 0 into the <code span class="fw-bold">NPCs</code> field and search. Gradually increase by 1 until the number inside the top row of the <code span class="fw-bold">Jump</code> column matches the number inside the <code span class="fw-bold">Curr. Adv</code> field.</li>
        <li>Close and re-open the pause menu a few times to make sure that the calculated NPC count is correct.</li>
      </ol>

    </div>
    </div><br>

    <p>Take note of the calculated delay and NPC count, you will need this information in order to reach the correct target frame later. Do not change position after calculating the number of NPCs, as this is subject to change depending on positioning.</p>

      <div class="card-body card-bg">

        <h6 class="fw-bold">Step-by-step tutorial:</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Advance towards your target frame using any of the methods listed inside the table on the <a href="https://billo-guides.github.io/cfw/swsh/overworld">main page</a>. Consider date skipping to advance large distances.</li><p></p>
          <li>Once you are close a few thousand frames away from the target, head back to the correct position in-game (see Figure 2).</li><p></p>
          <li>Pause the game, then disconnect and reconnect to the Main Window and press the search button again. This will be the new target frame.</li><p></p>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>From this point it is recommended to advance towards the target using only menu close prediction & animation advancements. These methods advance frames in small increments, making them easy to keep track of.</blockquote>

        <ul>
          <li>Open the Menu Close Advances Viewer tab, and type the number of NPCs (calculated earlier) into the <code span class="fw-bold">NPCs</code> field.</li><p></p>
          <li>Then type your target frame into the <code span class="fw-bold">+</code> field and search, factor in the delay that was calculated earlier (Example: <code span class="fw-bold">1000 (target) - 3 (delay) = 997 (new target)</code>).</li><p></p>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>If you are unable to find your target frame in the search results, use animations to advance the RNG state by 1, repeat until your target frame is visible inside the Menu Close Advances Viewer window.<br><br>

          If you cannot hit your target frame using menu close prediction, use it to get as close as you can. Afterwards you can use an alternative advancement method (e.g player movement) to hit your target frame.</blockquote>

        <ul>
          <li>Open and close the pause menu until closing the menu a single time lands onto your target frame, according to the <code span class="fw-bold">Menu Close Advances Viewer</code> prediction.</li><p></p>
          <li>Close the pause menu and quickly run towards the spawn point of your Pokémon and initate an encounter! Confirm you have hit the expected result by clicking the <code span class="fw-bold">Read Encounter</code> button when in battle.</li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>If you encountered an unexpected result, this either means you missed your target frame (too slow), the encounter did not spawn on time, or your delay is incorrect. Confirm your delay using the <a href="#delay-npc-count-symbol-cfw">above mentioned method</a> and retry.</blockquote>
