<hr />

If you made it this far, it must mean you have an interest in RNG abusing Pokémon from static encounters! This page will cover the whole process, from finding a desirable location to achieving a final result.<br /> <br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Getting Started:</span></h3>
<u>Before starting, do the following:</u>
<ul>
  <li>Open the GUI and click on the <code>Encounter Lookup</code> button at the top of the main window. This will open the Encounter Lookup tab.</li>
  <li>Type the species name of the Pokémon you are hunting into the empty field, this will bring up a list of every possible encounter and has all the information you need for the main window.</li>
  <li>Scroll down the list of encounters and click on one of the rows displaying a STATIC encounter, this will automatically enter the information into the main window.</li>
  <li>Head to the location in-game, change the date until you meet the correct weather condition, then stand near the spawn point of the Pokémon.</li>
  <li>Run far enough away to despawn the Pokémon and save.</li>
  <li>Press the Home button on your controller, click <code>Connect</code> on the main window of the tool.</li>
</ul>

It's suggested to pick an encounter in a quiet area with calm weather to reduce instability. Noise is area specific, you should test how noisy an area is before attempting to RNG abuse Pokémon in it.<br /> <br />

<span class="fw-bold">With all the required reading out of the way, it's time to get started!</span><br /><br />

<hr />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Time to get to work!</span></h3>
The goal is to walk towards the spawn point of the encounter on the calculated target frame displayed on the generator. The advancement methods used are listed on the main page of the guide.<br /><br />

Static encounters are guaranteed to be the same species every time until the weather in the area changes, weather changes on each new day. As long as the correct weather conditions are set we will get the same species in the same location every time the player walks into the spawn radius of the Pokémon.<br /><br />

In this example we will be aiming for a Shiny Duraludon with a mark in Giant's Seat. You can be more specific with the filters if you wish, such as filtering for a specific mark or specific IVs.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Awesome, everything looks good!</span> Time to find an ideal position to stand in-game and set the correct weather condition.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 2 -</span> Game setup<br />
<img src="./images/static/figure-2-in-game-setup.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<u>This location in Giant's Seat is ideal, there are no NPCs around and there are no spawned Pokémon present.</u><br /><br />

Giant's Seat is located in the Wild Area which is a notably quiet area in calm weather conditions.<br /><br />

Once the main window is filled in correctly & you are stood in a good position in-game, you can begin looking for target frames by clicking the search button on main window of the generator.<br /><br />

<u>If your results are not desirable, repeat the following:</u>
<ol>
  <li>Disconnect your Switch from the tool.</li>
  <li>Restart your game and enter the overworld.</li>
  <li>Enter the pause or Home menu and reconnect your Switch to the tool.</li>
  <li>Search again, do this until you have desirable results.</li>
</ol>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure  3 -</span> Target found!<br />
<img src="./images/static/figure-3-static-search-duraludon.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">We found one!</span> A shiny, Adamant natured Duraludon in a cluster on advances 1000-1001. These are the "target frames" and the aim will be to spawn Duraludon in the overworld on either of these frames.<br /><br />

Once a Pokémon is spawned in the overworld the stats and internal details (such as PID/EC) are generated and set in stone, this is why it is only important to spawn the Pokémon in the overworld on the correct frame.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Don't let the Pokémon despawn after you spawn it in the overworld!</span><br /><br />

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Advancing towards the target:</span></h5>
The generator displays the target on frame 1000-1001, based on local testing the delay for this static encounter is 0. This means the target remains at frame 1000-1001.<br /><br />

<u>Step by step:</u><br />
<ol>
  <li>Advance towards the target frame using bike, NPCs or by spawning overworld Pokémon in the area.</li><br />
Consider using the <code>DaySkip</code> feature of the GUI to advance large distances.<br /><br />

  <li>Once you are close to the target (within ~500 frames), stand near to the spawn point of the Pokémon you are hunting and click the <code>Update States</code> button.</li><br />
This will update your current seeds at the top right of the window.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">From this point it's recommended to only advance using menu close, animation and bike advancements as they only advance in small increments, making them easy to keep track of.</span><br /><br />

  <li>Quickly close and reopen the pause menu, pay attention to the number of advancements that have passed from doing so (shown in the <code>Curr. Adv.</code> field on the main window), repeat this step roughly 5 times.</li><br />
It's important to know the average number of frames that will advance from closing the pause menu, we will eventually need to account for this to hit the correct target frame.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">From this point it's recommended to only advance using animations from the <u>party menu</u>, this provide a stable +1 advancement per input.</span><br /><br />

  <li>Open the party menu and advance to your target frame using animations, here's where we need to factor in the amount of advances that pass from closing the pause menu.</li><br />
For example, if 3 frames advance from closing the pause menu on average and the target was 100 advances away, we would advance to frame 97 using animations, then closing the pause menu would pick up the 3 advancements we need to hit the target frame.<br /><br />

  <li>Close the pause menu and quickly run towards the spawn point of your Pokémon! Encounter it, then click the <code>Read Encounter</code> button. Make sure it matches the output shown on the generator.</li><br />
Remember not to let it despawn!<br />
</ol>

You can be creative with the methods you use to advance the RNG state.<br /><br />

By using animations and the <code>Curr. Adv.</code> field of the generator to keep track of inputs, we were able to hit out target frame!<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">The Duraludon matches the output of the tool, mission accomplished!</span><br /><br />

Espeon in party slot 1 with the ability Syncronize was used to determine the nature, using a Pokémon with this ability will make the nature of any overworld Pokémon match the nature of yours.<br /><br />

Different areas & environments can have a drastic influence on delay, if you are missing targets when you believe you should be finding results, you should consider reading the Troubleshooting Encounters section down below.<br /><br />

<hr />

<div class="bg-secondary title">
  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Troubleshooting Encounters</h1>
</div>

<hr />

This section covers how to troubleshoot encounters and delays. If you keep missing targets, spawning in the wrong Pokémon, or can't find your result on the RNG tool, this is the place to be.<br /><br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Missing Targets:</span></h3>
<u>The commonly occuring reasons for missing a target Pokémon are:</u>
<ul>
  <li>Encounter spawned too late or too early due to mistiming.</li>
  <li>There is a delay left unaccounted for.</li>
  <li>Information in the main window was not completely accurate.</li>
</ul>

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Encounter spawned too late or too early...</span></h5>

This is a common issue players will face when tackling static encounters and is likely due to mistiming when spawning the Pokémon. Retry and search for a new target frame and make sure your player positioning is correct.<br /><br />

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Troubleshooting delay...</span></h5>

For the purposes of this guide, the term "delay" is used to describe the frame difference between the Pokémon we encountered and the frame the encounter was initiated on.<br /><br />

Most static encounters do not need to account for delay, this applies most to encounters in extreme weather conditions or in an otherwise unstable environment, like having other spawned Pokémon present.<br /><br />

Delay Calc - <code>frame Pokemon was generated - frame encounter was initiated = delay</code><br /><br />

We can use the <code>Read Encounter</code> feature of the tool to confirm the exact frame the encounter was generated on and calculate the delay from there. Here's how it's done!
<ul>
  <li>Aim for a target, such as any shiny Pokémon.</li>
  <li>Run towards the Pokémon and spawn it in the overworld then initiate the encounter. Take note of the frame the Pokémon was spawned on.</li>
  <li>Encounter the Pokémon and click the <code>Read Encounter</code> button.</li>
  <li>If you didn't find the Pokémon that you expected, do a filterless search (or search for the specific IVs of the result you found) and find the frame you hit.</li>
  <li>Subtract your target advancement from the frame you actually hit.</li>
  <li>This will be your delay for that particular encounter.</li>
</ul>

<u>When RNG abusing in unstable conditions you should record delays for multiple attempts before aiming for a target and check for any consistent delay counts. It is also advised to aim for large clusters where possible to increase your chances of actually hitting the target.</u><br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 8 -</span> Delay troubleshooting example<br />
<img src="./images/static/figure-8-troubleshooting-encounters.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

We encountered an Duraludon, but it wasn't shiny! So what happened here? Well... We miscalculated. Let's try to find the frame we actually hit.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 9 -</span> Finding the frame<br />
<img src="./images/static/figure-9-locating-frame.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

By doing a filterless search we can see the the shiny cluster, and frame we hit was 2 frames behind where we wanted to be, oh well! We will adjust accordingly for next time by spawning it in the overworld 2 frames later.<br /><br />

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Cannot find result...</span></h5>
If you cannot find the Pokémon you are in battle with anywhere on the tool this is likely due to one of two reasons:
<ul>
  <li>Player was positioned too close to the spawn and the Pokémon had already been generated long before walking into it.</li>
  <li>The information entered into the main window of the tool was not completely accurate.</li>
</ul>

Try to reposition your character and see if your issue persists, if you are still having problems double check the information on the main tab is entered correctly by searching it on the <code>Encounter Lookup</code> and clicking the correct row.<br /><br /> 

<u>You must pay attention to the row you are clicking and making sure it matches your in-game environment.</u><br /><br />

That's all there is to it!<br /><br />
