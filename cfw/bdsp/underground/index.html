<hr />

<p>Grand Underground RNG manipulation can be used for any Pok&eacute;mon found within the whole of the Sinnoh Grand Underground. This can serve as an alternative method of RNG manipulation if you are opposed to manipulating standard wild encounters or eggs.</p>

    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <h6 class="fw-bold">How Does This Work?</h6>
        <p>In Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl the game determines the outcome of "random" events using a constantly advancing RNG seed. Using tools like PokeFinder and SysBot.NET we are able to predict the outcome of these random events and understand exactly when a desirable result will be produced and take advantage of this.</p>

        <p>Moarencounterbots is able to track and monitor RNG seeds in real time as well as advance the RNG state until a given point, removing the vast majority of work that would otherwise be tedious. This allows the player to put their efforts into more important factors like hitting their target frame instead.</p>

        <h6 class="fw-bold">Additional Information</h6>
        <p>Pok&eacute;mon that are generated within a Pok&eacute;mon Hideaway will remain spawned until the player leaves the cave. This means that the only time sensitive portion of this RNG is ensuring that you enter the correct cave on the right frame. Your target Pok&eacute;mon can then be encountered at any point before leaving the Pok&eacute;mon Hideaway.</p>

        <p>Any Pok&eacute;mon found inside Pok&eacute;mon Hideaways can also be hatched from egg, with the exception of Ditto. <a href="/cfw/bdsp/egg" target="_blank">Egg RNG manipulation</a> can provide boosted shiny rates and higher IVs, so we recommend using it instead Grand Underground manipulation where possible (or if you are NOT targeting Ditto). If you still wish to proceed however, you can continue following the content on this page.</p>

    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>Ensure you have all the required items and Pok&eacute;mon you will need to successfully capture your target Pok&eacute;mon, after doing so, set your game up in this specific state:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Head to the overworld location that contains your target Pok&eacute;mon, then use the Explorer Kit to bring up the Grand Underground connectivity options.</li>
            <li>Select the <code class="fw-bold">Play alone</code> option, then enter the Grand Underground and navigate close to the Hideaway that contains your target.</li>
            <ul>
                <li><a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/bdsp/underground/correct-positioning.gif">This GIF</a> demonstrates the ideal positioning your character should be in before saving the game.</li>
                <li>Entering and exiting the Hideaway that contains your target Pok&eacute;mon will put you within a one-tile radius of the loading zone, which is ideal for this RNG.</li>
                <li>You can also take this time to ensure that the correct Pok&eacute;mon is placed in the lead position of your party, for example, if you are using a Pok&eacute;mon with the ability Synchronize for nature control purposes.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>After confirming that you are properly set up you should save the game, then close and re-open the software from the Switch System Menu. This will help to remove any unwanted advancements.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Restarting the game may seem unnecessary but is a requirement for the sake of consistency. If you do not save and restart the game after entering the Grand Underground you will observe that the RNG state still advances with the Switch Home Menu open. This makes the RNG manipulation process more difficult than it needs to be.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>To easily obtain your current seed at any given point you can use the <code span class="fw-bold">EncBotCopySeedBS</code> routine in Moarencounterbots. If you have already followed the setup instructions found on the main page the bot should be configured to output the seed in the way PokeFinder expects. If you did not do this yet or your settings have changed for whatever reason, follow these instructions:</p>

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">Settings Toggles</span></h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Open SysBot.exe and navigate to the <code class="fw-bold">Hub</code> tab.</li>
            <li>Open the <code class="fw-bold">EncounterRNGBS</code> dropdown menu to display the relevant settings.</li>
            <li>Under <code class="fw-bold">DisplaySeedMode</code>, select <code class="fw-bold">Bit64PokeFinder</code>.</li>
            <li>Set the value in <code class="fw-bold">MonitorRefreshRate</code> to <code class="fw-bold">0</code>.</li>
        </ol>

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">Grabbing Seed Information</span></h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate back to the <code class="fw-bold">Bots</code> tab, enter your IP address, then add <code class="fw-bold">EncBotCopySeedBS</code>.</li>
            <li>Stand in the overworld in-game, press the <code class="fw-bold">Home</code> button, then click <code class="fw-bold">Start All</code>.</li>
            <li>Navigate to the <code class="fw-bold">Logs</code> tab. Your seed should be visible here (split into 2 sections referred to as "Seed 0" and "Seed 1").</li>
            <li>By default your seed will be copied to clipboard, but pasting directly into PokeFinder will not work.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Copy the top half of the seed into the <code class="fw-bold">Seed 0</code> field of PokeFinder.</li>
                <li>Copy the bottom half of the seed into the <code class="fw-bold">Seed 1</code> field of PokeFinder.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>You can now click the <code class="fw-bold">Generate</code> button to search for targets that match your parameters.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>You may wish to calibrate your Delay/Offset first before searching for target frames! See below for more information.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>

        <p>If you do not find any results consider increasing your search range, applying less strict search filters, or restarting the game to generate a new seed. Repeat this process until a desirable seed has been found.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>For encounters in the Grand Underground it is in your best interest to calibrate your commonly hit Delay/Offset, as it will be slightly variable depending on your current location. In most cases you should expect to see Offsets of 0-2, but may experience more significant variation.</p>

        <p>It is assumed that you have <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/bdsp/underground/correct-positioning.gif">optimal positioning</a> when calibrating delay. Ensure that you are positioned optimally before continuing.</p>

        <h6 class="fw-bold">Step-by-step</h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Launch the game then enter the Switch Home Menu by pressing the <code class="fw-bold">Home</code> button on your controller. You should now be on the <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/bdsp/misc/home-menu.jpg">home menu</a> with your cursor hovered over the game you are playing.</li>
            <li>Add <code class="fw-bold">EncBotRNGMonitorBS</code> to the list of active bots and click <code class="fw-bold">Start All</code>, then head over to the logs tab to observe your current RNG state.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The goal is to observe the number of advances consumed by entering the Pok&eacute;mon Hideaway, so you will need to keep a close eye on the logs tab going forward.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Press the <code class="fw-bold">Home</code> button again while holding the direction on your control stick that moves you into the loading zone of the Pok&eacute;mon Hideaway.</li>
            <li>As the screen transitions to black you will need to observe the amount of advances that are consumed by watching the logs tab.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Try to observe the number of advances that are consumed between you entering the Pok&eacute;mon Hideaway and the moment the Pok&eacute;mon was generated, this should be a low number (< 10) when positioned optimally.</li>
                <li>In my case (see above image) we can see that after entering the Pok&eacute;mon Hideaway there were 2 extra advances, then a large jump of 150 advances was observed. This indicates that the Pok&eacute;mon inside the Hideaway were generated.</li>
                <li>As two advances were consumed before the Pok&eacute;mon inside the Hideaway were generated, our Delay/Offset for this attempt is 2.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Exit the cave and repeat this process a few times from step 1 to figure out the offset you are most commonly hitting, then enter that value into the <code class="fw-bold">Offset</code> of the PokeFinder window.</li>

    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>In Figure 5 we can see that a Shiny Ditto will be produced in 278,402 advances. Earlier we calibrated a common offset of 2 and this value has been entered into PokeFinder. Now the goal is to generate the Pok&eacute;mon inside the Hideaway on the correct frame given by the PokeFinder search results.</p>

        <p>To automate the process of advancing the RNG state we will be using the Moarencounterbots <code class="fw-bold">EncBotDexFlipBS</code> routine. <code class="fw-bold">EncBotDexFlipBS</code> flips back and fourth between Pok&eacute;dex entries to advance the current seed until a given point. This quickest known method to advance the RNG state in this game.</p>

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">EncBotDexFlipBS Setup</span></h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to the <code class="fw-bold">Hub</code> tab and open the <code class="fw-bold">EncounterRNGBS</code> dropdown menu.</li>
            <li>Set your <code class="fw-bold">MaxTotalAdvances</code> relative to the amount needed to reach your target frame.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>It is recommended to subtract 10,000 from the total number of required advances to give yourself time to position your character properly after the seed advancing has been completed.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Head back to the <code class="fw-bold">Bots</code> tab and remove any currently active bots.</li>
            <li>Add the <code class="fw-bold">EncBotRNGMonitorBS</code> and <code class="fw-bold">EncBotDexFlipBS</code> bots instead.</li>
            <li>Open the Pokedex in-game in either Sinnoh or National mode.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Enter a section of the Pok&eacute;dex that has at least 10 registered Pok&eacute;mon in a row to increase effectiveness of the DexFlip routine. It is recommended to place cursor somewhere in the middle of the Pok&eacute;dex if you can.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Disconnect any controllers, then click the <code class="fw-bold">Start All</code> button on Moarencounterbots.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If everything was <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/bdsp/static/moarencounterbots-dexflip-demo.gif">done correctly</a> you should now see that the bot has started to flip between Pok&eacute;dex entries very quickly.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Navigate to the <code class="fw-bold">Logs</code> tab and wait for the DexFlip routine to complete.</li>
            <li>Click <code class="fw-bold">Stop All</code> once DexFlip has finished to completely stop any active bots.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If the bot does not begin flicking through Pokedex entries after clicking <code class="fw-bold">Start All</code> to initiate the DexFlip routine, stop the bot and confirm that all controllers have been fully disconnected and click <code class="fw-bold">Start All</code> again. This routine relies on taking control of button inputs and will not work if any other controllers are connected to the device. Controllers can be resynced after the routine has completed.</p>
