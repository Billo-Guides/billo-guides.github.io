<p>This guide offers a in-depth coverage of how to use RNG abuse to manipulate encounters, gifts, and eggs in Pokémon Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl, using tools and scripts developed by <a href="https://github.com/Lusamine">Lusamine</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Admiral-Fish">Admiral Fish</a>. You can utilize RNG abuse to obtain shiny Pokémon with high IVs and desirable natures, as well as determine other attributes like gender and size.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #b60606;">From here it is assumed you are using a CFW Switch console running <a href="https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/releases">Atmosphere</a>, this guide is also geared towards users running Windows OS machines.</span></p>

<p>It is recommended to build the latest commit of Moarencounterbots if you are able to do so. A pre-compiled download is included above to assist those who are unable to build the program themselves. If you wish to compile the application yourself, click the button directly below.</p>

</div><hr />

<p><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #b60606;">From ths point onwards, it is assumed that you are able to run all of the above mentioned applications, and that sys-botbase has been properly installed.</span></p>

<p>It is important to understand how to use each of the applications used for the RNG abuse process. If you are unfamiliar with how to use PokeFinder, Moarencounterbots or PokeViewer, this is the place to start.</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 1 -</span> PokeFinder Overview<p></p>
<a href="overworld/images/main-page/figure-1-pokefinder-overview.gif" target="_blank"><img src="overworld/images/main-page/figure-1-pokefinder-overview.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"></a><br /><br />

<div class="card border-dark">
  <div class="anchored card-header" style="background-color: #96324c;" id="pokefinder-overview">
    <span class="fw-bold text-light">PokeFinder Overview:</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>PokeFinder is used to predict upcoming RNG advancements based on a given seed. When you first launch PokeFinder, you'll see a small window where you can select your game. For Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl, look under the Generation 8 tab. After selecting the game, a larger "main window" will appear.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>The left hand side is for search conditions, here we can select the type of encounter, enter our seeds, and input the amount of advances to search through.</li>
      <li>The central portion is where specific details about the Pokemon will be entered, such as species, and parents if the chosen type of encounter is an egg.</li>
      <li>The right hand side is for inputting search filters, this is used for finding specific desirable results, such as only outputting shiny or high IV frames.</li>
      <li>The top portion is for profile management, input your trainer information such as OT, TID, SID, Game & Variables. Your 5 digit (internal) TID/SID is only required for Egg RNG abuse.</li>
    </ul>

    <details>
      <summary><span class="fw-bold">Finding your internal TID/SID</summary>
      <p>We recommend using ><a href="https://projectpokemon.org/home/files/file/1-pkhex/">PKHeX</a> to find your 5 digit TID/SID combination. You will need to <a href="https://projectpokemon.org/home/tutorials/save-editing/managing-switch-saves/">extract your save file</a> from your console to use this method.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Open your save file in PKHeX with at least one self obtained Pokemon in your party or boxes.</li>
        <li>View any Pokemon by right clicking it, then clicking the <code span class="fw-bold">View</code> button.</li>
        <li>Navigate to the <code span class="fw-bold">OT/Misc</code> tab, here you will see the trainer details of the Pokemon.</li>
        <li>Hover over the <code span class="fw-bold">TID</code> field using your mouse, you will see two 5 digit values (e.g 12345(TID)/54321(SID).</li>
        <li>Take note of these values and enter them into the profiles sub-window of PokeFinder, then save and close the window.</li>
      </ul>
    </details><p></p>

    <blockquote>Ensure you have the correct profile loaded for the save file you are currently using! Especially if you intend to RNG abuse eggs. Eggs are the only encounter type that have a shiny odds increase from the Shiny Charm.</blockquote>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 2 -</span> Moarencounterbots Overview<p></p>

  <div class="anchored card-header" style="background-color: #96324c;" id="moarencounterbots-overview">
    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Moarencounterbots Overview:</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Pictured above is the window you are presented with upon launching <code span class="fw-bold">Moarencounterbots - SysBot.exe</code>. Moarencounterbots is used for monitoring RNG seeds and automating the main bulk of the RNG advancement process.</p>

    <p>To connect your console to SysBot.NET you will need the local IP address, this can be found by opening the Homebrew Menu on your console, then pressing the Y Button. Enter this IP address into the assigned field on SysBot. Bot type can then be selected using the drop-down menu on the right.</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
    <p>There are four bot types that will be used throughout this guide, these are:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><code span class="fw-bold">EncBotRNGMonitorBS</code> - Used to monitor your RNG seed in real time.</li>
      <li><code span class="fw-bold">EncBotCopySeedBS</code> - Used to copy your RNG seed to clipboard at any point.</li>
      <li><code span class="fw-bold">EncBotTIDBS</code> - Used to automate the process of TID RNG abuse.</li>
      <li><code span class="fw-bold">EncBotDexFlipBS</code> - Used to automatically advance the RNG state until a given point.</li>
    </ol>

    <blockquote>General information and usage tips can be found on the official <a href="https://github.com/Lusamine/SysBot.NET/wiki">Moarencounterbots Wiki</a>. We recommend becoming familiar with each of these bot types before continuing.</blockquote>

    <span class="fw-bold text-light">PokeViewer Overview:</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Pictured above is the window you are presented with upon launching <code span class="fw-bold">PokeViewer.exe</code>. PokeViewer is used to read the details of a Pokemon during a battle or found inside boxes, which is necessary for troubleshooting after missing a target.</p>

    <p>To connect your console to PokeViewer.NET you will need the local IP address, this can be found by opening the Homebrew Menu on your console, then pressing the Y Button. Enter this IP address into the assigned field on PokeViewer, then connect after launching the game.</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
    <p>There are two main features used throughout this guide, these are:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><code span class="fw-bold">EncounterView</code> - Used to view the details of an opposing Pokemon during a battle.</li>
      <li><code span class="fw-bold">BoxView</code> - Used to view the details of a Pokemon located inside boxes.</li>
    </ol>
