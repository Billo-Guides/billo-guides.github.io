<p>This page covers how to manipulate your PokeRadar chain length. This type of RNG manipulation is used to reach high chains to be granted high IV/Shiny odd bonuses. The PokeRadar chain length RNG abuse script is capable of outputting frames that will break your chain based on your current seed.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #b60606;">From here it is assumed that you have read and followed all of the information found on the initial page of the PokeRadar guide.</span></p>

    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Important Information</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>PokeRadar chains have a chance of breaking based on multiple factors, it is important to understand how to play to achieve maximum odds of keeping your chain alive, as the PokeRadar Chain Length script assumes that you are playing perfectly and have the highest odds of maintaining a chain.</p>
    
    <h6><span class="fw-bold">What is "perfect play"?</span></h6>
    <ul>
      <li>Starting a chain using a Radar patch that is 4 tiles away from the player.</li>
      <li>Capturing the Pokemon that spawns instead of defeating it.</li>
      <li>Avoid doing anything that is guaranteed to break a chain, found on the initial page.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Doing all of the above will grant a 93% chance of maintaining a chain, you cannot boost your odds any further. By knowing this information, we can use the PokeRadar Chain Length script to predict which advancements will break the chain, and avoid them.</p> 

    <blockquote>Contrary to common belief, the game decides if the chain will break at the end of the battle, shortly after the exp gain screen.</blockquote>

    <span class="fw-bold text-light">In-game Setup</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>In Figure 1, the player activate a Max Repel, and is standing in the middle a large patch of grass with the PokeRadar chain app open on the Poketch to keep track of chain length.</p>

    <p>After using the PokeRadar 4 patches of grass have appeared. We then initiated a battle by entering a grass patch 4 tiles away from the player, and encountered the desired Pokemon, if the species you encountered is not desirable, restart the chain by running from the battle and using the PokeRadar again.</p>

    <p>We then captured Ditto, granting a 93% chance of continuing the chain. Once the exp gain screen appeared, the Home button was pressed to pause the game (freezing the RNG state).</p>

    <p><span class="fw-bold">Important -</span> bring at least 1 Pokemon on your team that is capable of gaining exp, this will make the RNG abuse process more stable as it is possible to freeze the RNG state on the Exp gain screen, then end the battle at any given point.</p>

    <blockquote>If you do not have access to plenty of Master Balls to capture Pokemon, it is recommended to bring a Pokemon that you can use to effectively capture the Pokemon from the PokeRadar chain, such as a Pokemon with the move False Swipe and a high attack stat.</blockquote>

    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Final Actions</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>In the above image, the game is paused using the Home menu on the Exp gain screen, then <code span class="fw-bold">EncBotCopySeedBS</code> was used to obtain the current seed, this seed was then pasted into the script and a result was produced.</p>

    <p>The produced result is unsafe, as there are many frames that we can potentially land on that will break the chain (frames that will cause the chain to break are marked with an <code span class="fw-bold">*</code>). Now the goal is to wait for a safe frame.</p>

    <p>The amount of frames consumed after leaving a battle is variable, typically between 25-80 frames. Aim to end the battle with as little amount of frames that will break your chain as possible in the 25-80 frame range, it may take a short while to find something like this.</p>
      
    <p>Simply unpause the game, allow wait a few seconds to allow the RNG state to advance, then pause the game with the Home menu and check your seed again, repeat until you find a safe enough frame to end the battle on.</p>

    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Safe Frame Found</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>After finding a safe enough frame (the Figure 3 example only has 1 frame that will cause a chain break), quickly spam the <code span class="fw-bold">A</code> button to end the battle, if done correctly your chain will continue. Repeat this process to reach your desired chain length.</p>

    <span class="fw-bold">ENSURE THAT YOU ARE ONLY ENCOUNTERING POKEMON THAT ARE IN PATCHES 4 TILES AWAY FROM THE PLAYER!</span> Stand in the middle of the grass patch and use the PokeRadar again if no ideal patches are produced.</p>

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Desirable Chain Lengths</span></h6>
    <ul>
      <li>40+ grants the best possible shiny odds.</li>
      <li>A chain of exactly 20 grants 1 flawless IV.</li>
      <li>A chain of exactly 30 grants 2 flawless IVs.</li>
      <li>A chain of exactly 40 grants 3 flawless IVs.</li>
      <li>A chain of exactly 100 grants 5 flawless IVs.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>If you are aiming for the IV bonus you should aim to be on the chain before your bonus. For example if you want the IV bonus from having a chain of 40 you should aim for a chain of 39, then the next encountered Pokemon will have the IV bonus.</blockquote>

<p>After repeating the method explained above, a chain of 39 has now been reached according to the PokeRadar, which means the next encountered Pokemon in the chain will have 3 guaranteed IVs. Now we can continually spam the radar while avoiding encounters until a shiny patch appears.</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 5 -</span> Shiny Patch Found<p></p>

<p>A shiny patch has been found on a chain of 39, granting a guaranteed shiny Pokemon with 3 perfect IVs. <span class="fw-bold">Mission accomplished!</span></p>
