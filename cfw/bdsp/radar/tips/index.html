    Understand the basic mechanics of the Pok&eacute;Radar and how things work under the hood before diving into the actual manipulation process.
</small>
<hr />

<p>The primary use case for manipulating the Pok&eacute;Radar is to find high IV, shiny Pok&eacute;mon by building up a high chain. It is important to understand how chains work in order to give yourself the best possible chance of keeping an active chain alive.</p>

        <span class="fw-bold text-light">About Pok&eacute;Radar Chains</span>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>After using the Pok&eacute;Radar in a large grass patch, four of the surrounding patches will begin rustling around the player. Encountering any of the Pok&eacute;mon found inside the rustling grass will begin a chain of the encountered species. When the battle ends the game decides the likelihood the chain continuing based on how you decided to play.</p>

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">What is considered "optimal play"?</span></h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Starting a chain using a grass patch that is 4 tiles away from the player in any direction (including diagonal).</li>
            <li>Capturing all Pok&eacute;mon encountered during your chain, you will want to stock up on strong Pok&eacute; Balls because of this.</li>
            <li>Avoiding doing any of the following, as they are guaranteed to end your chain:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Encountering a Pok&eacute;mon through a normal wild encounter.</li>
                <li>Running from a Pok&eacute;mon encountered using the Pok&eacute;Radar.</li>
                <li>Mounting your bike while the Pok&eacute;Radar music is active.</li>
                <li>Leaving the area by entering any loading zone.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Continuing to encounter Pok&eacute;mon in grass patches that are 4 tiles away from the player in any direction.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you find that no grass patch within four tiles has spawned, recharge the Pok&eacute;Radar by taking 50 steps and use it again. Repeat until one appears.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>

        <p>Following these rules will grant a 93% chance of the chain continuing once the battle ends. This means that even with optimal play there is still a 7% chance the chain will randomly break, but this can be controlled with RNG manipulation!</p>

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">Radar Bonuses</span></h6>
        <p>After reaching specific chain lengths the game grants boosts to shiny rates and the number of guaranteed IVs the next encountered Pok&eacute;mon will have. Detailed information about shiny rates boosts can be found on <a href="https://www.serebii.net/brilliantdiamondshiningpearl/pokeradar.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Serebii's BDSP PokeRadar page</a>, but most notably...</p>

        <ul>
            <li>At a chain of 19, the next encountered Pok&eacute;mon will have 1 guaranteed max IV.</li>
            <li>At a chain of 29, the next encountered Pok&eacute;mon will have 2 guaranteed max IVs.</li>
            <li>At a chain of 39, the next encountered Pok&eacute;mon will have 3 guaranteed max IVs.</li>
            <li>At a chain of 99, the next encountered Pok&eacute;mon will have 5 guaranteed max IVs.</li>
            <li>When a chain reaches 39, the chances of finding a shiny Pok&eacute;mon are boosted to 1/200.</li>
            <li>Once a chain reaches 40 or above, the chances of finding a shiny Pok&eacute;mon caps out at 1/99.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Keep this information in mind going forward as it may influence how you decide to play. For example, you may decide to reach a chain of 39 and continually recharge the Pok&eacute;Radar until you find a <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/bdsp/radar/shiny-patch-demo.gif">shiny patch</a>, as this will also grant the encountered shiny Pok&eacute;mon a boost of 3 guaranteed max IVs.</p>

        <p>You will need to do some initial prep work before getting started with the RNG. The setup required for a seemless experience (particularly with chain length manipulation) might seem oddly specific, but try to follow this information closely.</p>

        <p>It may be difficult to gather all of the ideal items and Pok&eacute;mon required to optimize the RNG experience, but since everyone following this guide should have Switch Custom Firmware you may wish to consider editing your save file to meet the requirements below using <a href="https://projectpokemon.org/home/files/file/1-pkhex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PKHeX</a> (instructions on how to edit your save file will not be covered in this guide).</p>

        <hr />

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">Bag Setup</span></h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Have plenty of strong Pok&eacute; Balls, ideally Master Balls, to be able to capture Pok&eacute;mon from Radar encounters easily. You will need at least as many as the length of the chain you are trying to achieve.</li>
            <li>Have plenty of Repels, ideally Max Repels, to avoid unintentionally encountering a random Wild Pok&eacute;mon.</li>
            <li>Pok&eacute;Radar and Pok&eacute;tch app acquired, these can be obtained from Professor Oak at Ramanas Park after completing the main story.</li>
            <li>Have the Pok&eacute;Radar as your only registered item to avoid unintentionally performing actions like mounting the bike (optional but highly recommended).</li>
        </ol>
        <hr />

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">Party Setup</span></h6>
        <ol>
            <li>A full team of six Pok&eacute;mon to avoid having caught Pok&eacute;mon go straight into your party as this can cause issues.</li>
            <li>Five team members at level 100, with a fainted or level 90+ Pok&eacute;mon as the final team member. The goal here is to avoid the level up text at the end of a battle.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Ideally, your lead Pok&eacute;mon should be a level 100 Zubat. Using a Zubat makes the RNG advance more slowly than with most other Pok&eacute;mon due to it not having a blinking animation (it has no eyes!).</li>
                <li>The lead Pok&eacute;mon can be switched to a Pok&eacute;mon with the ability Synchronize when it is time to manipuate the encounter instead of the chain.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>A high level Pok&eacute;mon with the ability Synchronize that is a higher level than the Pok&eacute;mon on the route to avoid triggering an unwanted encounter when Repel is active.</li>
        </ol>

    <p><span class="fw-bold">Info -</span> At this stage you should have a good understanding of how Pok&eacute;Radar chains work and how to set up your game for the best possible experience when it comes to manipulating the Pok&eacute;Radar. Next, you can move on to learning about the actual manipulation process. It is recommended to start with chain length manipulation and then move onto encounter manipulation once you have built up your desired chain.</p>

    Keep this page open to refer to later if you need a refresher Pok&eacute;Radar chain mechanics or what the ideal in-game setup looks like, as this information will be relevant as you continue following the guide.
