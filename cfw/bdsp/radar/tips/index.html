    Understand the basic mechanics of the Pok&eacute; Radar before diving into the RNG manipulation process.
</small>
<hr />

<p>The primary goal of manipulating the Pok&eacute; Radar is to find high IV Shiny Pok&eacute;mon by building up a long chain. A common target is Ditto because there are few ways to obtain a breeding Ditto natively; the only other method is the Underground. It is important to understand how radar chaining works to give yourself the best possible chance of keeping an active chain alive.</p>

        <span class="fw-bold text-light">About Pok&eacute; Radar Chains</span>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>After using the Pok&eacute; Radar in a large grass patch, four of the surrounding patches will begin rustling around the player. Encountering any of the Pok&eacute;mon found inside the rustling grass will begin a chain of the encountered species. When the battle ends, the game decides the likelihood the chain continuing based on how you decided to play.</p>
        <hr />

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">What is considered "optimal play"?</span></h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Starting a chain using a grass patch that is 4 tiles away from the player in any direction (including diagonal).</li>
            <li>Capturing all Pok&eacute;mon encountered during your chain.</li>
            <li>Continuing to encounter Pok&eacute;mon in grass patches that are 4 tiles away from the player in any direction.</li>
            <li>Avoiding any of the following, which are guaranteed to end your chain:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Encountering a Pok&eacute;mon through a normal wild encounter. Use Repels to avoid random wild encounters.</li>
                <li>Running from a Pok&eacute;mon encountered using the Pok&eacute; Radar.</li>
                <li>Riding your bike while the Pok&eacute; Radar music is active.</li>
                <li>Leaving the area or entering any loading zone.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>If you find that there are no shaking grass patches that are 4 tiles away, recharge the Pok&eacute; Radar by taking 50 steps and use it again. Be careful not to accidentally step on any of the current shaking grass patches. Repeat until one appears.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>

        <p>Following these rules will give us the maximum 93% chance of the chain continuing once the battle ends. This means that even with optimal play, there is still a 7% chance the chain will randomly break, but this can be avoided with RNG manipulation!</p>

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">Radar Bonuses</span></h6>
        <p>As the chain length increases, the game boosts shiny rates and the number of guaranteed max IVs the next encountered Pok&eacute;mon will have. Detailed information about shiny rates for each chain length can be found on <a href="https://www.serebii.net/brilliantdiamondshiningpearl/pokeradar.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Serebii's BDSP Pok&eacute; Radar page</a>, but most notably...</p>

        <ul>
            <li>At a chain of 19, the next encountered Pok&eacute;mon will have 1 guaranteed max IV.</li>
            <li>At a chain of 29, the next encountered Pok&eacute;mon will have 2 guaranteed max IVs.</li>
            <li>At a chain of 39, the next encountered Pok&eacute;mon will have 3 guaranteed max IVs.</li>
            <li>At a chain of 99, the next encountered Pok&eacute;mon will have 5 guaranteed max IVs.</li>
            <li>When a chain reaches 39, the chances of finding a shiny Pok&eacute;mon are boosted to 1/200.</li>
            <li>Once a chain reaches 40 or above, the chances of finding a shiny Pok&eacute;mon caps out at 1/99.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Keep this information in mind as it may influence how you decide to play. For example, you may decide to reach a chain of 39 and repeatedly recharge the Pok&eacute; Radar until you find a <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/bdsp/radar/shiny-patch-demo.gif">shiny patch</a>, as this will also grant the encountered Shiny Pok&eacute;mon a bonus of 3 guaranteed max IVs.</p>

        <span class="fw-bold text-light">In-Game Setup</span>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>You will need to do some initial preparation work before getting started with the RNG manipulation. The setup required for a seamless experience (particularly with chain length manipulation) might seem oddly specific, but try to follow these recommendations closely.</p>

        <p>It may be difficult to gather all of the ideal items and Pok&eacute;mon required to optimize the RNG experience. Since everyone following this guide should have Switch Custom Firmware, you can consider editing your save file to meet the requirements below using <a href="https://projectpokemon.org/home/files/file/1-pkhex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PKHeX</a> (instructions on how to edit your save file will not be covered in this guide).</p>

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">Bag Setup</span></h6>
        <p>The goal with the bag is to have enough supplies to catch every Pok&eacute;mon we encounter while building the chain. We also want to avoid running into any Pok&eacute;mon that will break the chain. We recommend:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Pok&eacute; Radar and Pok&eacute;tch app acquired from Professor Oak at Ramanas Park after completing the main story.</li>
            <li>Plenty of good Pok&eacute; Balls so you can capture Pok&eacute;mon from Radar encounters easily. You will need at least as many as the length of the chain you are trying to achieve. Depending on play preferences, you can consider stocking up on Quick Balls, Repeat Balls, or Master Balls.</li>
            <li>Plenty of Repels, ideally Max Repels, to avoid unintentionally encountering a random Wild Pok&eacute;mon.</li>
            <li>Healing items if there is a chance of failing a catch and being attacked.</li>
            <li>Pok&eacute; Radar as your only registered item to avoid unintentionally performing actions like mounting the bike. This is optional but highly recommended.</li>
        </ol>
        <hr />

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">Party Setup</span></h6>
        <p>This party setup prevents party members from leveling up, ensures that the battle finishes on the experience gain screen, and keeps Repel effective with a high-level lead Pok&eacute;mon. We recommend:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>A full team of 6 Pok&eacute;mon so newly-caught Pok&eacute;mon go to your box instead of your party. Low level Pok&eacute;mon in your party can gain Exp. Points and level up, which causes problems for RNG manipulation.</li>
            <li>A level 100 lead Pok&eacute;mon that will not gain experience and will keep your Repel working.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Ideally, your lead Pok&eacute;mon should be a level 100 Zubat. Using a Zubat causes the RNG state to advance more slowly than when using most other Pokémon. (We suspect this is due to it not having a blinking animation since it has no eyes!)</li>
                <li>The lead Pok&eacute;mon can be switched to a Pok&eacute;mon with the ability Synchronize when it is time to manipulate the encounter instead of the chain.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>At least 1 fainted Pok&eacute;mon of any level. This will allow the experience gain screen to appear with <code class="fw-bold">+0</code> gained, but we can avoid the level up at the end of a battle.</li>
            <li>Any other 4 Pok&eacute;mon that are either fainted or level 100 to avoid the problems previously stated.</li>
            <li>A Pok&eacute;mon with the Synchronize ability that is higher level than the Pok&eacute;mon on the route to avoid triggering an unwanted encounter when Repel is active. This can be one of your party members if it meets the previous requirements.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Note that you can safely access the PC Boxes remotely while a radar chain is active. You can make use of this feature to swap around party members that are unsuitable or if you need to pick up your Synchronize Pok&eacute;mon.</p>

    <p><span class="fw-bold">Information -</span> At this stage, you should have a good understanding of how Pok&eacute; Radar chains work and how to set up your game for RNG manipulating the Pok&eacute; Radar. Next, you can move on to learning about the actual RNG manipulation process. We recommend first learning how to calibrate the encounter delay for the area you will be chaining in so you can consistently manipulate the stats of Pok&eacute; Radar encounter once you reach your desired chain length.</p>

    You can refer back to this page if you need a refresher on Pok&eacute; Radar chain mechanics or what the ideal in-game setup looks like. The next page will open in a new tab, so you can easily switch back and forth between the two pages as needed.
