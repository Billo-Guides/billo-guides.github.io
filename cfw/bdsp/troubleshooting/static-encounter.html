        <p>We initiated the encounter by pressing the <code class="fw-bold">A</code> button on frame 8,721, which was expected to produce a shiny Heatran based on the PokeFinder search results. However, the Heatran we are in battle with is not shiny. This indicates that we did not hit our intended target frame. Common causes for missing a target frame include the following:</p>

        <ol>
            <li span class="fw-bold">Delay configured incorrectly in PokeFinder.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Confirm that your delay has been entered correctly by referring to the delay table found on the Static page. Expected delay will vary depending on the encounter you are targeting.</li>
            </ul>
            <li span class="fw-bold">Delay is variable due to Player/Pok&eacute;mon blinks or overworld environment.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Players/Pok&eacute;mon blink at random which causes the RNG state to advance. This is beyond our control and is simply a result of being unlucky.</li>
            </ul>
            <li span class="fw-bold">Encounter was initiated too late or early.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Pressing the <code class="fw-bold">A</code> button too late or too early will result in missing your target frame, the goal is to initiate the encounter on the exact frame(s) given by the PokeFinder search results table.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>

        <p>We will now need to open PokeViewer.NET and read the encounter to inspect the internal details of the Pok&eacute;mon we are in battle with. This information will help us to confirm the exact frame we hit.</p>

    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>After connecting to PokeViewer.NET and heading over to the <code class="fw-bold">View</code> tab we can inspect the Pok&eacute;mon we are in battle with by clicking the <code class="fw-bold">View</code> button. We will use this information to find the Pok&eacute;mon we actually hit using PokeFinder, then compare the difference in advances between the Pok&eacute;mon we actually hit and our target frame.</p>

        <p>Enter the IVs of the Pok&eacute;mon into the PokeFinder search filters and remove any other search filters such as setting the shiny filter to <code class="fw-bold">Any</code>, <span class="fw-bold">DO NOT CHANGE THE SEEDS OR CONFIGURED DELAY</span>.</p>

        <p>Once you have reconfigured the search filters properly click the <code class="fw-bold">Generate</code> button again. You should now see the Pok&eacute;mon you are in battle with inside the search result table. If you see multiple results, compare the EC value on PokeFinder and PokeViewer to find the exact frame.</p>

        <p>Our expected shiny Heatran was on advance 8,721 but the Heatran we are in battle with was generated on advance 8,722. This means that we have overshot our target frame by 1 advance. To account for this we will need to adjust our delay in PokeFinder by +1 and attempt the RNG again, in this example we will need to change the delay from 84 to 85.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Overshooting target =</span> Increase delay in PokeFinder.</li>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Undershooting target =</span> Decrease delay in PokeFinder.</li>

<p>After adjusting the delay to 85 in PokeFinder we were able to hit our target frame and encounter a shiny Heatran!</p>

    <span class="fw-bold">Information -</span> Depending on the speed of the natural RNG advances in the area you may need to calibrate your delay multiple times before seeing any level of consistency. Shaymin, Drifloon and Spiritomb are the most notable instances of fluctuating delay, as the natural RNG in the areas that contain those Pok&eacute;mon is very noisy.
