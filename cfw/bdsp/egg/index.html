    Learn the entire process of manipulating Day-Care eggs using the Oval Charm method.
</small>
<hr />

<p>Egg RNG manipulation can be used for any Pok&eacute;mon that hatches from an egg received from the Day-Care Couple in Solaceon Town. For best results, it's recommended to use a high-IV Ditto from a different language than your game. A foreign Ditto can breed with nearly any Pok&eacute;mon and offers high breeding compatibility. Additionally, using two Pok&eacute;mon from different language games activates the Masuda Method, which increases the chance of generating a shiny egg.</p>

        <span class="fw-bold text-light">Understanding BDSP RNG</span>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <h6 class="fw-bold">How Does This Work?</h6>
        <p>In Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl the game determines the outcome of "random" events using a constantly advancing RNG seed. Using tools like PokeFinder and SysBot.NET we are able to predict the outcome of these random events and understand exactly when a desirable result will be produced and take advantage of this.</p>

        <p>Moarencounterbots is able to track and monitor RNG seeds in real time as well as advance the RNG state until a given point, removing the vast majority of work that would otherwise be tedious. This allows the player to put their efforts into more important factors like hitting their target frame instead.</p>

        <h6 class="fw-bold">Egg Generation</h6>
        <p>Eggs have a chance of being generated after the player deposits the Pok&eacute;mon in the Day-Care and walks exactly 180 steps, this is known as the "egg step counter". There are two different methods that the game uses to generate eggs depending on whether or not the player has obtained the Oval Charm, these are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Oval Charm Method - </span> Egg details are generated once the Day-Care man is holding the egg and is set in stone until the player has recieved it (STABLE).</li>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">No Charm Method - </span> Egg details are generated at the exact moment the player accepts the egg from the Day-Care man (UNSTABLE).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Due to the instability of natural RNG advances in Solaceon Town it is recommended to gain access to the Oval Charm before attempting to manipulate eggs. By using the Oval Charm method we can generate the egg in a location with more stable natural RNG advances then recieve the egg from the Day-Care man at any point.</p>

            <li>Select the Masuda checkbox if the two parents you are using are of different languages (Masuda Method).</li>

        <p>To easily obtain your current seed at any given point you can use the <code span class="fw-bold">EncBotCopySeedBS</code> routine in Moarencounterbots. If you have already followed the setup instructions found on the main page the bot should be configured to output the seed in the way PokeFinder expects. If you did not do this yet or your settings have changed for whatever reason, follow these instructions:</p>

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">Settings Toggles</span></h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Open SysBot.exe and navigate to the <code class="fw-bold">Hub</code> tab.</li>
            <li>Open the <code class="fw-bold">EncounterRNGBS</code> dropdown menu to display the relevant settings.</li>
            <li>Under <code class="fw-bold">DisplaySeedMode</code>, select <code class="fw-bold">Bit64PokeFinder</code>.</li>
            <li>Set the value in <code class="fw-bold">MonitorRefreshRate</code> to <code class="fw-bold">0</code>.</li>

            <li>Stand in the overworld in-game, press the <code class="fw-bold">Home</code> button, then click <code class="fw-bold">Start All</code>.</li>
            <li>Navigate to the <code class="fw-bold">Logs</code> tab. Your seed should be visible here (split into 2 sections referred to as "Seed 0" and "Seed 1").</li>
            <li>By default your seed will be copied to clipboard, but pasting directly into PokeFinder will not work.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Copy the top half of the seed into the <code class="fw-bold">Seed 0</code> field of PokeFinder.</li>
                <li>Copy the bottom half of the seed into the <code class="fw-bold">Seed 1</code> field of PokeFinder.</li>
            </ul>

Now the goal generate the egg on the exact frame given by the PokeFinder search results, to do this we will need to visit a more stable area. Any in-door location with 0 NPCs is ideal for the purposes of this RNG, in this example we will be using the upper floor of the players home in Twinleaf Town.</p>

            <li>Move away from the stairs, but do not take more than 179 steps to avoid generating an egg at the wrong time.</li>
            <li>Press the <code class="fw-bold">Home</code> button to pause the game, then run <code class="fw-bold">EncBotCopySeedBS</code> again to get your new seed.</li>

            </ul>
            <li>Navigate to the <code class="fw-bold">Logs</code> tab and wait for the DexFlip routine to complete.</li>
            <li>Click <code class="fw-bold">Stop All</code> once DexFlip has finished to completely stop any active bots.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If the bot does not begin flicking through Pokedex entries after clicking <code class="fw-bold">Start All</code> to initiate the DexFlip routine, stop the bot and confirm that all controllers have been fully disconnected and click <code class="fw-bold">Start All</code> again. This routine relies on taking control of button inputs and will not work if any other controllers are connected to the device. Controllers can be resynced after the routine has completed.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Press the <code class="fw-bold">Home</code> button, then run <code class="fw-bold">EncBotCopySeedBS</code> and enter your new seed into PokeFinder. Search for your target again to get your new target frame.</li>
            <li>Remove <code class="fw-bold">EncBotCopySeedBS</code> and add and start <code class="fw-bold">EncBotRNGMonitorBS</code> instead to begin monitoring your RNG state.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Confirm that you have started a fresh instance of <code class="fw-bold">EncBotRNGMonitorBS</code>. Seed monitoring should begin from advance 0, NOT wherever you left off!</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Resume the and take steps until the Poketch step counter displays 179, the next step taken after this point should generate your egg.</li>
            <li>Monitor the RNG state until you reach your target frame, this should match the exact frame shown on PokeFinder's search result table.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>You may optionally choose to manually advance the RNG state by scrolling the Pokedex. Be careful not to overshoot your target!</li>
                <li>A technique called "Home button mashing" is used to help ensure that we land directly onto our target frame. Quickly pressing the Home button twice will resume, then pause the game. We can use this technique to inch closer to our target frame and land directly onto it in most cases.</li>
                <li>In the unlikely event that we cannot land directly onto our target frame this will need to be treated as a failure and you will need to restart the process again by finding a new seed and target frame.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>You should now be on the Home menu and the SysBot <code class="fw-bold">Logs</code> tab should indicate that you have reached your target frame. Unpause the game while holding a direction on your control stick to take a step an hopefully generate your egg.</li>
            <li>Head to Solaceon Town and speak to the Day-Care man to claim your egg, you can do this at any point as the details of the egg should have already been generated.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Egg generation has a chance to fail, if this happens treat the RNG as a failure and try again starting from the point of depositing the correct parents into the Day-Care.</li>
            </ul>

<p>We have resumed the game on our target frame pressed taken a step to generate our egg. Now it is time to confirm that we have hit the correct target frame by visiting the Day-Care man and accepting the egg. We can then view the details of the egg in PokeViewer.NET to see if we hit the correct frame.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold">Figure 8 -</span> Result Found</p>

<p>After claiming the egg from the day-care man then opening PokeViewer.NET and using the <code span class="fw-bold">Box View</code> function to view the details, we can see that our egg matches the PokeFinder search result. Mission accomplished!</p>
