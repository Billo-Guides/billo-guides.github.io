<hr />

<p>Fishing encounters refer to encounters that are deliberately triggered by throwing a fishing rod into a body of water. Old Rod, Good Rod and Super Rod can be used to generate a fishing encounter but the table of Pok&eacute;mon that can be generated will change depending on the type of rod that was used.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <h6 class="fw-bold">How Does This Work?</h6>
        <p>In Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl the game determines the outcome of "random" events using a constantly advancing RNG seed. Using tools like PokeFinder and SysBot.NET we are able to predict the outcome of these random events and understand exactly when a desirable result will be produced and take advantage of this.</p>

        <p>Moarencounterbots is able to track and monitor RNG seeds in real time as well as advance the RNG state until a given point, removing the vast majority of work that would otherwise be tedious. This allows the player to put their efforts into more important factors like hitting their target frame instead.</p>

        <h6 class="fw-bold">Additional Information</h6>
        <p>Fishing manipulation consists of two separate phases. The first phase is hooking the encounter by <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/bdsp/final-a-presses/fishing-bag.jpg">using a fishing rod</a>, which determines and locks in the Pok&eacute;mon species. The second phase is <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/bdsp/final-a-presses/fishing-textbox.jpg">reeling it in</a>, which determines internal details such as IVs, nature, and shiny status. Essentially we will be performing two seperate RNGs to obtain a specified target Pok&eacute;mon.</p>

        <p>Any Pok&eacute;mon found via fishing can also be hatched from egg, <a href="/cfw/bdsp/egg" target="_blank">egg RNG manipulation</a> is much more stable so we recommend using it instead of fishing RNG manipulation where possible. If you're aware of the added instability that comes with fishing RNG manipulation and still wish to proceed, continue following the content on this page.</p>

            <li>Enter the amount of advances you wish to search through into the <code class="fw-bold">Max Advances</code> field.</li>
            <li>Configure your search filters, such as filtering for a shiny Pok&eacute;mon with 0 IVs in attack.</li>
            <li>You do not need to configure a delay. The internal details of the Pok&eacute;mon are generated on the exact frame it was reeled in on.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Having a Pokemon with the ability Syncronize ensures that all encountered Pok&eacute;mon have the same nature as your synchronizer. Ensure that your synchronizer is the first team member in your party or it will not work.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>To easily obtain your current seed at any given point you can use the <code span class="fw-bold">EncBotCopySeedBS</code> routine in Moarencounterbots. If you have already followed the setup instructions found on the main page the bot should be configured to output the seed in the way PokeFinder expects. If you did not do this yet or your settings have changed for whatever reason, follow these instructions:</p>

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">Settings Toggles</span></h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Open SysBot.exe and navigate to the <code class="fw-bold">Hub</code> tab.</li>
            <li>Open the <code class="fw-bold">EncounterRNGBS</code> dropdown menu to display the relevant settings.</li>
            <li>Under <code class="fw-bold">DisplaySeedMode</code>, select <code class="fw-bold">Bit64PokeFinder</code>.</li>
            <li>Set the value in <code class="fw-bold">MonitorRefreshRate</code> to <code class="fw-bold">0</code>.</li>
        </ol>

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">Grabbing Seed Information</span></h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate back to the <code class="fw-bold">Bots</code> tab and add <code class="fw-bold">EncBotCopySeedBS</code>.</li>
            <li>Stand in the overworld in-game, press the <code class="fw-bold">Home</code> button, then click <code class="fw-bold">Start All</code>.</li>
            <li>Navigate to the <code class="fw-bold">Logs</code> tab. Your seed should be visible here (split into 2 sections referred to as "Seed 0" and "Seed 1").</li>
            <li>By default your seed will be copied to clipboard, but pasting directly into PokeFinder will not work.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Copy the top half of the seed into the <code class="fw-bold">Seed 0</code> field of PokeFinder.</li>
                <li>Copy the bottom half of the seed into the <code class="fw-bold">Seed 1</code> field of PokeFinder.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Click the <code class="fw-bold">Generate</code> button to search for targets that match your parameters.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If you do not find any results consider increasing your search range, applying less strict search filters, or restarting the game to generate a new seed. Repeat this process until a desirable seed has been found.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>In Figure 3 we can see a shiny Gyarados will be produced in 13,731 advances, the goal will be to reel the Pok&eacute;mon in on this exact frame, but first we will need to find a frame that is close to our target frame that will generate the desired Pok&eacute;mon species, known as the "hook frame". To do this we will need to do a seperate PokeFinder search.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Manually remove any search filters you may have applied, excluding the encounter slot filter (e.g IVs, Shiny, Nature, Ability, Gender or Hidden Power filters).</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Do not click <code class="fw-bold">Disable Filters</code> checkbox, this will not work for our use case as we need to preserve the encounter slot filter.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Take note of your current target frame in a text editor such as Notepad, you will need this information later.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In my case my shiny target is on advance x so I will take note of this in my text editor.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Search again, this time you will need to find a frame that is close to your target that will hook the Pok&eacute;mon.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>This is indicated by the <code class="fw-bold">Hook</code> column of the search result table, look for any frame that has a <code class="fw-bold">Yes</code> that is close to your target frame.</li>
                <li>Aim to find a hook frame within 500-1000 advances of your actual target frame, this will reduce the wait time after throwing the rod into the water.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Once you have found your hook frame you will need to use a calculator to find the offset between your hook frame and your target frame (<code class="fw-bold">target frame - hook frame = hook frame offset</code>).</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In my case, my target frame is 13,731 and my hook frame is 13,469, subtracting 13,469 from 13,731 gives a difference/offset of 262.</li>

        <p>Once you've identified your hook frame and calculated the offset you can reapply any previously set search filters and search for your actual target frame again. We will now need to advance the RNG state to the desired hook frame.</p>

            <li>Open the Pokedex in-game in either Sinnoh or National mode.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Enter a section of the Pok&eacute;dex that has at least 10 registered Pok&eacute;mon in a row to increase effectiveness of the DexFlip routine. It is recommended to place cursor somewhere in the middle of the Pok&eacute;dex if you can.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Disconnect any controllers, then click the <code class="fw-bold">Start All</code> button on Moarencounterbots.</li>

            </ul>
            <li>Navigate to the <code class="fw-bold">Logs</code> tab and wait for the DexFlip routine to complete.</li>
            <li>Click <code class="fw-bold">Stop All</code> once DexFlip has finished to completely stop any active bots.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If the bot does not begin flicking through Pokedex entries after clicking <code class="fw-bold">Start All</code> to initiate the DexFlip routine, stop the bot and confirm that all controllers have been fully disconnected and click <code class="fw-bold">Start All</code> again. This routine relies on taking control of button inputs and will not work if any other controllers are connected to the device. Controllers can be resynced after the routine has completed.</p>

        <p>At this point you should be around 10,000 advances or less away from your target hook frame. To confirm exactly how far away you are you will need to remove all currently active bots, then add and start <code class="fw-bold">EncBotCopySeedBS</code>.</p>

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">Step-by-step</span></h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Press the <code class="fw-bold">Home</code> button, then run <code class="fw-bold">EncBotCopySeedBS</code> and enter your new seed into PokeFinder. Search for your target again with any relevant search filters applied to get your new "reel in" frame.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Confirm that you have started a fresh instance of <code class="fw-bold">EncBotRNGMonitorBS</code>. Seed monitoring should begin from advance 0, NOT wherever you left off!</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Head to the location of your desired Pok&eacute;mon in-game if you have not already done so. Surf on any body of water and face a direction where you can throw in your fishing rod.</li>
            <li>Resume the game and observe how quickly the RNG state is advancing. Your next action will depend on the speed of the natural RNG advances.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If the RNG state is advancing slowly, manually scroll your Pok&eacute;dex slowly until you 1000 advances (or less) away from your target, then open your bag.</li>
                <li>If the RNG state is advancing quickly, manually scroll your Pok&eacute;dex slowly until you 1000 advances (or more) away from your target, then open your bag.</li>
                <li>In any case, at this point you should have your bag open on the <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/bdsp/final-a-presses/fishing-bag.jpg">fishing rod selection screen</a>.</li>
