<hr />

<p>This guide provides in-depth coverage of how to use <a href="https://github.com/LegoFigure11/RaidCrawler/">RaidCrawler</a>, a program created by <a href="https://github.com/LegoFigure11">LegoFigure11</a> that can be used to read the contents of Tera Raid dens in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet.</p>

<p>RaidCrawler is capable of scanning and displaying all active Tera Raid dens on the map. It automatically searches for raids that meet user-defined filter criteria, eliminating the need to manually check each den. This feature grants a significant timesave.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #b60606;">From here this guide assumes you are using a CFW Switch console running Atmosphere. You must have also progressed far enough in-game to have gained access to Tera Raids.</span></p>

<div class="card border-dark">
  <div class="anchored card-header" style="background-color: #0c0038;" id="download-and-installation-raidcrawler">
    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Download & Installation</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Required Downloads:</span></h6>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/LegoFigure11/RaidCrawler/releases/">RaidCrawler</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0">.NET 8.0</a></li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>.NET 8.0 is a program dependency, this means that RaidCrawler will be unable to function without having this installed onto your computer.</blockquote>

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Installation Instructions:</span></h6>
    <ol>
      <li>Download and extract all the contents from the <code class="fw-bold">RaidCrawler.zip</code> into an empty folder.</li>
      <li>Move the <code class="fw-bold">atmosphere</code> folder (sys-botbase) to the root of your Switch SD card then reboot the console.</li>
      <li>Download and run <code class="fw-bold">dotnet-sdk-8.0.x-win-x64.exe</code>, then go through the setup instructions.</li> 
    </ol>

    <blockquote>Latest versions of RaidCrawler are bundled with a sys-botbase fork, this is required to remotely communicate with your console and utilize application features.</blockquote>

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">RaidCrawler Initial Setup:</span></h6>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the Homebrew menu by clicking the album button on the Switch home screen, then press the Y Button, this will provide the local IP address of the console.</li>
      <li>Enter the local IP address into the assigned <code class="fw-bold">Switch IP:</code> field on the top left of the RaidCrawler window, then click the <code class="fw-bold">Connect</code> button.</li>
      <li>If the installation instructions were followed correctly you should now see that RaidCrawler has began to scan the contents of your save file, such as story progression values.</li>
      <li>Once the <code class="fw-bold">Status</code> at the bottom of the window has changed to <code class="fw-bold">Completed</code>, you should see the contents of all of the active Tera Raid dens.</li>
    </ol>

    <blockquote>
      <p>For read errors, remove all overlays (Tesla, Capturesight etc.) & cheats (Edizon etc.) then reboot the console.</p>
      For connection errors, re-install sys-botbase and check that your PC and console are using the same network.
    </blockquote>
  </div>
</div><br />

<p><span class="fw-bold">Once you have followed all of the above steps and confirmed that the console is able to communicate with RaidCrawler, you can begin with the Program Setup portion of the guide.</span></p>

<hr /><div class="title" style="background-color: #0c0038;">
  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Program Setup</h1>
</div><hr />

<p>The below image displays the window you will be presented with after opening RaidCrawler for the first time. For the purposes of this guide, this is referred to as the "Main window".</p>

    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Feature Overview:</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <h6 span class="fw-bold">Raid Controls:</h6>
    <p>Inside the <code class="fw-bold">Raid Controls</code> box on the main window we can see various buttons, here's some information about what each button does:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code class="fw-bold">Read Raids</code> - Re-scans for active raids at any given point.</li>
      <li><code class="fw-bold">Screenshot</code> - Takes a screenshot of the game for sharing using <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks">Webhooks</a>.</li>
      <li><code class="fw-bold">Open Map</code> - Shows the location of the currently viewed raid on the world map.</li>
      <li><code class="fw-bold">Dump Raid</code> - Dumps the raid block (for researchers & raid preservation).</li>
      <li><code class="fw-bold">Pull Events</code> - Pulls the most recent promotional event raid data.</li>
      <li><code class="fw-bold">Rewards</code> - Shows the reward items given to the player after completing the raid.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you have an active Raid Power sandwich, set the <code class="fw-bold">Raid Sandwich Boost</code> level according to the level of the active sandwich. This is used to determine the bonus reward items given after completing a raid.</p>
  </div>
</div><br />

<p>After taking some time to understand the various features of the main window, you will then need to apply the relevant search filters & configure the program settings.</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 2 -</span> Filter Overview<br />
<a href="/cfw/sv/images/raidcrawler/Figure2.gif" target="_blank"><img src="/cfw/sv/images/raidcrawler/Figure2.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"></a><br /><br />

    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Filter Condition Information</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p span class="fw-bold">Clicking the <code span class="fw-bold">Edit Filters</code> button will open the Filter Settings sub-window. Here you can decide the conditions that will stop the program automatically scanning for raids.</p>

    <p>RaidCrawler uses a DateSkipping routine to automatically advance the date, which refreshes all active Tera Raids. Using smart filtering we can ensure that RaidCrawler only stops on desired target raids. Clicking each checkbox will activate the
      corrisponding field (demonstrated in Figure 2).</p>

    <p>It's possible to set multiple filters if you are searching for more than one target, it is also possible to combine filters conditions together if you are looking for something specific, such as a shiny Pokemon with specific IVs.</p>

    <details>
      <summary span class="fw-bold">Example:</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Clicking the <code span class="fw-bold">Shiny?</code> checkbox then updating the filter will look for any shiny Pokemon.</li>
        <li>Clicking the <code span class="fw-bold">Species</code> checkbox, setting a desired species, then updating the filter add a second filter for Pokemon of the chosen species.</li>
        <li>If we are seeking a shiny Pokemon of a specific species, we would combine both of these filters into one instead.</li>
        <li>If we are seeking ANY shiny Pokemon OR a Pokemon of a specific species, we can set the filters independently to look for one or the other instead of seeking both.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>
    <hr />

    <p>You can also apply <a href="https://projectpokemon.org/tutorials/save-editing/using-pkhex/how-to-use-the-batch-editor-in-pkhex-r77/">batch filters</a> in order to filter for anything that is not already listed in the sub window. This is a more
      advanced filtering method that will not be covered in this guide. 99% of use cases will be covered by the filters that already exist inside the sub window.</p>

    <h6 span class="fw-bold">Date Skipping:</h6>

    <p>With the help of sys-botbase, RaidCrawler is able to take over the console and perform automated date advancements. By doing so, all of the active raids will be refreshed & re-scanned. This process is repeated until a desired result has been found.</p>

    <p>Pressing the <code class="fw-bold">Advance Date</code> button on the main window will initiate the date skipping routine, the method used will be based on what has been selected inside the <code class="fw-bold">Advance Date</code> tab of the <code class="fw-bold">Settings</code> window. There are multiple different options available to choose from.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Zyros' method is the most time optimal method, this utilizes a <a href="https://github.com/zyro670/usb-botbase">custom sys-botbase fork</a> to perform advancements, capable of completing a scan every 5 seconds.</li>
      <li>Touch screen inputs is the second quickest (but less consistent) method of date skipping using the Switch system settings.</li>
      <li>DDown inputs is the default method that is slower (but more consistent) than the touch screen input method.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>For Zyros' date advancement method, Date & Time must be synced via the internet inside the Switch system settings. All controllers must also be disconnected from the console before beginning pressing the <code class="fw-bold">Advance Date</code> button on the main window.</p>

     <details>
      <summary><span class="fw-bold">System settings advancements setup:</span></summary>

      <p>The default routine is configured for generic V1 Switch consoles, if you are using a Lite or an OLED, or are having any inconsistencies using the overshoot setting on any type of console when using the default routine, you will need to change the value inside <code class="fw-bold">Time to hold to overshoot "Date and Time"</code> or use DDOWN inputs instead.</p>

      <p>Date & Time must not be synced by the internet if you are using this method. All controllers must also be disconnected from the console before beginning pressing the <code class="fw-bold">Advance Date</code> button on the main window.</p>

        <div class="col">
          <table class="table table-striped">
            <thead class="table-dark">

<p>From this point the guide assumes you have a stable connection to the program and both the settings & filters set appropriately. <b>It's time to begin searching for a target!</b></p>

<div class="title" style="background-color: #0c0038;">
  <h1 class="anchored   text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">The Process</h1>
</div>

<p>In this example we will be searching for any shiny Pokemon, you can be more specific with the filters if you wish, such as filtering for a specific species or IV values.</p>

    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Filter Configuration</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>The filters have been set to search for any shiny Pokemon (as seen in figure 4), we can now close this sub window and begin scanning for a desired raid.</p>

    <p>Enter the overworld in-game and pause to open the map, then click <code class="fw-bold">Connect</code> on the main window of RaidCrawler. After you have connected and have the map open, desync any controllers that are currently connected. This
      will allow us to effectively use the date skipping routine and automate the hunting process.</p>

    <p>Click the <code class="fw-bold">Advance Date</code> button to initiate the date skipping routine, RaidCrawler should now begin advancing the date and scanning for new raid dens automatically until a result has been found.</p>

  <div class="anchored card-header" style="background-color: #0c0038;" id="TargetFound">
    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Target Found!</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>After scanning the raid dens and advancing the system date using Date Skipping, we were able to quickly find our desired Tera Raid and we have been provided with the following information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Seed, PID and EC, the PID will be <mark>highlighted gold</mark> if it is a shiny Pokemon</li>
      <li>Pokemon species and Tera typing</li>
      <li>The general location of the raid on the map</li>
      <li>Raid difficulty (star count)</li>
      <li>The IVs of the raid</li>
      <li>If raid is part of a promotional event distribution</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By clicking the <code class="fw-bold">Open Map</code> button we are able to see the general location(s) of the raid on the world map. Navigate towards the area that contains the raid to confirm the result in-game matches the output on
      RaidCrawler. If two or more locations are displayed in the map, visually cross-check RaidCrawler&apos;s map with the in-game map to determine which one to use.</p>
  </div>
</div><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 6 -</span> Result Found!<br />
<a href="/cfw/sv/images/raidcrawler/Figure6.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/cfw/sv/images/raidcrawler/Figure6.jpg" style="width:675px;height:400px;"></a><br /><br />

<p>The raid matches the output displayed by RaidCrawler, once you have confirmed a match you can either capture the raid for yourself, or reset the game and host the raid for members of the community. <u>Make sure to disable Autosave and then
    manually save the game before entering the raid if you intend to share it with other players.</u></p>

<span class="fw-bold">That's all there is to it!</span> You can now repeat everything you have learned from this guide to effectively hunt for any Tera Raids that you desire.
