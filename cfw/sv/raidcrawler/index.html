  This guide will provide coverage of how scan Tera Raid dens in Scarlet/Violet by using the RaidCrawler program developed by <a href="https://github.com/LegoFigure11">LegoFigure11</a>.
  RaidCrawler can be used to read <span class="fw-bold">all</span> of the Tera Raid dens on the map, this can be used to scan for shininess and/or specific IV values.<br /> <br />
  
  <span class="fw-bold">This guide assumes you are using a CFW Switch console running Atmosphere. This is also technically <u>NOT</u> RNG abuse!</span> This is considered closer to brute force RNG than true RNG abuse.<br /> <br />

      Pictured above is RaidCrawler, by connecting our console to this program we can scan all of the active Tera Raids on the map, and even continue until a shiny Pokemon is found using automated date skipping!<br /><br />

      To start with, enter the local IP address of your Switch console into the <code>Switch IP:</code> field, then click connect. You should now notice that the status has changed to <code>Reading raid block...</code>, then set your game version and story progression level inside the dropdown menus on the left.<br /><br />

          <li>New game</li>
          <li>5 gym badges obtained</li>
          <li>8 gym badges obtained</li>
          <li>Elite 4 beaten</li>
          <li>6 star raids unlocked</li>

        </details><br />

        <ul>
        <li>The <code>Read Raids</code> button can be used at any time, this is particularly useful if you are manually advancing the date.</li>
        <li>The <code>Advance Date</code> button can be used to automate the date skipping process, be sure to desync any controllers before clicking this button or it will not work.</li>
        <li>When the <code>Continue until shiny?</code> checkbox is active, the program will advance the date until a shiny Tera Raid appears, this is extremely useful for players who don't want to date skip and check manually.</li>
        <li>The arrow buttons are used to check the contents of each raid seperately. Each raid is indicated with a unique number /69.</li>
        <li>When the <code>Event?</code> checkbox is active, this means that the Tera Raid den currently being read is a promotional distribution Tera Raid.</li>
      </ul><br />

      <div class="card-body" class="text-light" style="background-color: #0c0038;">
        <p><span class="fw-bold">Note:</span> In order to use the <code>Date Skip</code> feature it is advised to desync all controllers currently connected to your Switch console or have only Joy-Cons attached to the console.</p>

        You should also disable <code>Syncronize Clock via Internet</code> in your console system settings.

     <div class="card-body" class="text-light" style="background-color: #0c0038;">
        <span class="fw-bold">Note:</span> Remove any overlays, cheats or cheating applications such as Edizon, Tesla and Capturesight if you are experiencing read errors.

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 2 -</span> Shiny Found!<br />
<img src="/cfw/sv/images/raidcrawler/figure-2.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

After scanning the raid dens and advancing the system date using <code>Day Skip</code> feature, we were able to quickly find a shiny raid and we have been provided with the following information:<br /><br />
<ul>
 <li>Seed, PID and EC, the PID will be <mark>highlighted yellow</mark> if it is a shiny Pokemon</li>
 <li>Pokemon species and Tera typing</li>
 <li>The general location of the raid on the map</li> 
 <li>Raid difficulty</li>
 <li>The IVs of the raid (For accurate reads it is important to set your game progression level correctly)</li>
 <li>If raid is an event distribution</li>
</ul>

By using this information we can navigate towards the area that contains our shiny Pokemon to confirm the result in-game matches the output on RaidCrawler.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 3 -</span> Result Found!<br />
<img src="/cfw/sv/images/raidcrawler/figure-3.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

After finding and capturing your result, you can begin date skipping and scanning raids immediately for quick and effective Tera Raid shiny hunting.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">That's all there is to it!</span>
