<p>This guide provides in-depth coverage of how to RNG abuse Legendary Pokemon in Legends: Arceus, using RNG scripts written by Lusamine and scanner bots created by Zyro670.</p>

<p>In Legends: Arceus, it is possible to RNG abuse certain legendary Pokemon for desirable IVs & Natures, the method used to RNG abuse these Pokemon can vary depending on if the encounter uses Main RNG or is tied to a Spawner.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #b60606;">From here this guide assumes you are using a CFW Switch console running Atmosphere.</span></p>

  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <h3><span class="fw-bold">What is Main RNG?</span></h3>
    <p>Main RNG is what some encounters use to generate a Pokemon, this is a constantly ticking state and hitting the desired result will be based on correct/precise timing.</p>

    Encounters that use Main RNG are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>Origin Legendary (Dialga or Palkia)</li>
      <li>Opposite Legendary (Dialga or Palkia, depending on the Origin Pokemon chosen)</li>
      <li>Giratina</li>
      <li>Arceus</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><span class="fw-bold">What is a Spawner?</span></h3>
  <p>Spawners hold a specific Pokemon that is visible in the overworld, when a Legendary Pokemon on a spawner is knocked out the spawner seed will advance by 1 frame every time, this means that hitting a desired result will be based on KOing the Pokemon on the spawner and not based on timing.</p>
