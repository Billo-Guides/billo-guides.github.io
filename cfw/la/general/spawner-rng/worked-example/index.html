<hr />

<p>This page provides a worked example of how to effectively RNG manipulate Pok&eacute;mon that are tied to spawner RNG, if you have made it this far, you should already know which Pok&eacute;mon you wish to hunt, and have all of the relevant tools set up and ready to use.</p>

        <span class="fw-bold text-light">In-Game - Spawner RNG</span>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>Your in-game setup will vary depending on if your chosen Pok&eacute;mon is located inside of a cave, or is wandering in the overworld. Follow the images above for an example of good positioning, then save the game after doing so.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>For Uxie, Mesprit, Azelf, Heatran &amp; Manaphy, stand directly outside the cave enterance (pictured in Figure 1).</li>
            <li>For Cresselia, Shaymin, Darkrai, Tornadus, Thundurus, Landorus &amp; Enamorus, stand within talking distance of the guard in Jubilife (pictured in Figure 2)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Advancing the RNG state for this type of encounter involves repeatedly knocking out, then respawning the Pok&eacute;mon. For this reason you should stock up on Pok&eacute;balls (to capture the Pok&eacute;mon), healing items (such as Elixirs and Potions), and throwable items (such as Mud Balls &amp; Sticky Glob), as you cannot leave back to Jubilife after finding a seed.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Launch <code class="fw-bold">SysBot.exe</code>, at this point you should already have the mode configured for Legends: Arceus. If you have not yet done this, visit this page.</li>
            <li>Type the local IP address of your console into the IP field, your local IP can be found by opening the homebrew menu and pressing the Y button.</li>
            <li>Open the <code class="fw-bold">Hub</code> tab, then navigate to the <code class="fw-bold">EncounterLA</code> dropdown menu, here you can configure the bot based on the Pok&eacute;mon you are hunting.</li>
            <li>Set the <code class="fw-bold">OWLegend</code> to the Pok&eacute;mon you intend to hunt, then set the <code class="fw-bold">SearchDepth</code> to the amount of advances you wish to search through.</li>
            <li>In the <code class="fw-bold">StopConditions</code> dropdown menu, set the IVs/Nature to match your desired Pok&eacute;mon, close and reopen the program every time you change these settings.</li>
            <li>Navigate back to the <code class="fw-bold">Bots</code> tab, then open the dropdown menu on the right, select <code class="fw-bold">EncBotOWLCheckRNGLA</code>, then click the <code class="fw-bold">Add</code> button.</li>

        <span class="fw-bold text-light">About SearchDepth</span>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>The suggested <code class="fw-bold">SearchDepth</code> value will vary depending on the rarity of your Pok&eacute;mon. You should also consider if your Pok&eacute;mon respawns immediately or if in-game actions are required to respawn. Keep this in mind when choosing an appropriate <code class="fw-bold">SearchDepth</code> value.</p>

        <p><span class="fw-bold">Uxie, Mesprit, Azelf, Heatran &amp; Cresselia -</span> These will take roughly 30-60 seconds per advance and will respawn immediately after being defeated.</p>

        <p><span class="fw-bold">Manaphy, Shaymin, Darkrai, Tornadus, Thundurus, Landorus &amp; Enamorus -</span> These can take up to 5 minutes per advance and will require in-game actions to respawn them.</p>

    <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Finding A Target Seed</h1>
</div>
<hr />

<p>Ensure you have configured your SysBot settings and stopconditions properly before continuing, and confirm that you are standing in the correct position in-game depending on the Pok&eacute;mon you are hunting for (see above). You can now disconnect all controllers and click the <code class="fw-bold">Start All</code> button to begin looking for targets that match your search conditions.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold">Figure 4 -</span> Bot Started</p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/la/spawner-rng/worked-example/spawner-bot-started.gif" alt="spawner-example-cfw-4" class="img-fluid clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/la/spawner-rng/worked-example/spawner-bot-started.gif">

<p>You should now see that the bot has begun scanning the spawner seed and searching for a target. It may take a while to find a desirable target frame depending on how rare your stopconditions are. In this example we will be searching for an Enamorus within 10 advances with an attack IV of 0, and the bot will continually cycle through Jubilife and Crimson Mirelands until a result that meets these conditions has been found.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold">Figure 5 -</span> Target Found</p>

<p>The spawner seed and internal details of the Enamorus can be seen inside the <code class="fw-bold">Logs</code> tab. This seed can optionally be entered into the Spawner RNG Script to help with tracking your advances.</p> <p>If you do not want to use the spawner RNG script you can restart SysBot.NET at any point to check the number of advances remaining before you reach your target, but the information provided is less detailed than if you were to set up the Spawner RNG script.</p>

        <span class="fw-bold text-light">Spawner RNG Script Configuration</span>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>Paste your group seed from the <code class="fw-bold">Logs</code> tab of SysBot.NET to the group seed field at the top of the Spawner RNG script, then set your search range and desired species. In this case we will be setting the search range to 10 and species to <code class="fw-bold">Species TargetSpecies = Species.Enamorus;</code> as we are targeting Enamorus.</p>

        <p>Setting the species is particularly important for Heatran and Phione, as these two Pok&eacute;mon are generated slightly differently to everything else. Heatran does not have a fixed gender, and Phione does not have fixed Height/Weight values.</p>

        <p>After you have set the script up correctly, click the <code class="fw-bold" style="color: green;">â–¶</code> button, you should now see your upcoming advances in the script output found at the bottom of the LINQPad window.</p>

<p>This section covers how to advance the RNG state to reach your desired result, the method used to advance the RNG state will vary depending on your desired Pok&eacute;mon.</p>

        <span class="fw-bold">Despawns When Defeated</span><br />
        <p><small>Tornadus, Thundurus, Landorus, Enamorus, Shaymin &amp; Darkrai</small></p>

        <ol>
            <li>Knockout the legendary, then fly to a campsite.</li>
            <li>Sleep 3 times, night -> morning -> evening.</li>
            <li>Head to a cave and enter, then save and reboot the game.</li>
            <li>Fly back to the legendary and wait for it to respawn.</li>
            <li>Repeat from step 1 until the desired frame has been hit.</li>
        </ol>

        <span class="fw-bold">Note -</span> Tornadus, Thundurus and Darkrai only respawn in certain conditions, Tornadus in a Blizzard, Thundurus in a Thunderstorm, and Darkrai at night.
        <hr />

        <span class="fw-bold">Forced Capture</span><br />
        <p><small>Uxie, Mesprit, Azelf, Heatran &amp; Cresselia</small></p>

        <ol>
            <li>Knockout the legendary.</li>
            <li>Click through the menus until you regain control of your character.</li>
            <li>Repeat from step 1 until the desired frame has been hit.</li>
        </ol>

        <span class="fw-bold">Note - </span>All of these Pok&eacute;mon are located in caves, with the exception of Cresselia, come well prepared to avoid needing to leave the area.
        <hr />

        <span class="fw-bold">Unique Cases</span><br />
        <p><small>Manaphy</small></p>

        <ol>
            <li>Knockout the legendary, then fly to a campsite.</li>
            <li>Sleep 3 times, night -> morning -> evening.</li>
            <li>Warp to Fire Pit Island and enter the cave, then save and reboot the game.</li>
            <li>Fly back to Manaphy's cave, then wait until night time.</li>
            <li>Enter the cave, check to see if Manaphy has respawned.</li>
            <li>Repeat from step 1 until the desired frame has been hit.</li>
        </ol>

        <span class="fw-bold">Note -</span> Manaphy is a unique case, it is contained inside a cave but does not immediately respawn. The method used to respawn Manaphy is more akin to the method used for Overworld.

<p>After advancing the required amount, then engaging in battle with Enamorus, you can use PokeViewer.NET to confirm that the stats of the Pok&eacute;mon align with what is expected. You can also use the spawner RNG script to figure out exactly what advance you are on if the Pok&eacute;mon does not match what is expected.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold">That's all there is to manipulating Spawner RNG Legendary/Mythical Pok&eacute;mon using CFW!</span></p>
