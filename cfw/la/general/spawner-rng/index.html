</div><hr />

<p>This page will provide in-depth information about how to RNG abuse Legendary Pokemon in Legends: Arceus that are tied to what is known as Spawners. We will be using RNG automation programs written by <a href="https://github.com/zyro670">Zyro670</a>, as mentioned on the main page.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #b60606;">From here it is assumed that you have already followed all of the setup instructions for Spawner RNG abuse, found on the introductory page of this guide.</span></p>

    <span class="fw-bold text-light">About Spawner RNG:</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Pokemon that are tied to spawners have their seed generated when you enter the map or cave that they are located in. The seed remains the same until you defeat the Pokemon and have it respawn, this will be a consistent +1 advancement to the Spawner seed.</p>

    <p>Leaving the area and heading back to Jubilife HQ will refresh the spawner seed of every Pokemon on the map, including Legendary Pokemon. We can use <a href="https://github.com/zyro670/NotForkBot.NET/tree/NotKoiTest">Zyro670's Sysbot</a> to automate the seed checking process.</p>
    
    <p>It is recommended to have a strong Pokemon, lots of healing items (e.g Elixirs, Potions, Revives) and lots of throwable items (Ball of Mud, Sticky Glob etc.) before getting started. You will need enough resources to consistently defeat/stun the Legendary Pokemon that you are hunting.</p>
  </div>
</div><br>

<span class="fw-bold">Now we know the basics about Spawner-based encounters, it's time to get to work!</span>

<hr /><div class="title" style="background-color: #0c0038;">
  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Getting Started (Spawner RNG)</h1>
</div><hr />

<p>After you have gathered enough resources you will need to configure Sysbot.NET properly for the game you are using and the Pokemon you plan to hunt. In this example we will be hunting for Enamorus with flawless IVs.</p>

<div class="card border-dark">
  <div class="anchored card-header" style="background-color: #0c0038;" id="notforkbotsetup">
    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Sysbot.NET Setup & Instructions:</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <h5 class="fw-bold">Sysbot.NET Config:</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the Sysbot.NET application once and close it again to generate a <code class="fw-bold">config.json</code> file inside the same folder as Sysbot.NET.</li>
      <li>Open <code class="fw-bold">config.json</code> in a text editor like Notepad, then change the <code class="fw-bold">Mode</code> to 3 in order to use the Legends: Arceus bots, then save the changes.</li>
      <li>Open Sysbot.NET again, you should now see the <code class="fw-bold">Sysbot: Pokemon (LA)</code> in the header, this means the bot has configured for Legends: Arceus successfully.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Next, configure the bot to hunt for your desired Pokemon and set the amount of frames to search through, along with setting your desired StopConditions.</p>

    <h5 class="fw-bold">Spawner RNG Setup:</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the <code class="fw-bold">Hub</code> tab of Sysbot.NET, then open the <code class="fw-bold">ArceusLA</code> dropdown menu. This is where you will add the relevant information specific to your chosen hunt.</li>
      <li>Set the <code class="fw-bold">BotType</code> to the Pokemon you are hunting. For Genies use <code class="fw-bold">GenieScanner</code>, for Manaphy use <code class="fw-bold">ManaphyReset</code>, and for anything else use <code class="fw-bold">OtherLegendReset</code>.</li>
      <li>Open the <code class="fw-bold">SpecialConditions</code> dropdown menu, then select the correct <code class="fw-bold">ScanLocation</code> for the Pokemon you are hunting. (<u>Example</u>: for Enamorus, select Crimson Mirelands)</li>
      <li>If you have chosen <code class="fw-bold">OtherLegendReset</code>, you will also need to select the <code class="fw-bold">TypeOfLegend</code> that you are hunting to make sure the bot performs the correct routine.</li>
      <li>Set the <code class="fw-bold">MaxAdvancesToSearch</code> to an the amount of advancements you are comfortable with doing (50-100 is recommended).</li>
      <li>Set <code class="fw-bold">RunToProfessor</code> to false so you can take advantage of teleportation when leaving the area to save time.</li>
      <li>Scroll up to the top, and open the <code class="fw-bold">StopConditions</code> dropdown menu, type in your desired IVs/Nature combination, then restart the bot (close and re-open).</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Once you have configured the <code class="fw-bold">Hub</code> tab details properly head back over to the <code class="fw-bold">Bots</code> tab, then add the <code class="fw-bold">ArceusBot</code> using the local IP address of your Switch console.</p>

<img src="/cfw/la/general/images/spawner-rng/sysbot-setup-spawner.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<p>Your setup should look similar to the above image, the bot type is set to <code class="fw-bold">GenieScanner</code>, <code class="fw-bold">ScanLocation</code> set to Crimson Mirelands, and <code class="fw-bold">StopConditions</code> are set to 31/0/31/31/31/0, these are the required settings for hunting Enamorus.</p>

    <p>Different routines are used depending on the the Pokemon you are hunting and the area it is located in. This means that the in-game setup will also differ depending on which Pokemon you are hunting for.</p>

    <p>For Pokemon located <u>in the overworld</u>, you will need to start from Jubilife, then manually enter the map that contains the Pokemon you wish to hunt.</p>

    <p><span class="fw-bold">These are -</span> Tornadus, Thundurus, Landorus, Enamorus, Cresselia, Shaymin & Darkrai.</p>

    <p>For Pokemon located <u>inside caves</u>, you will need to save the game stood outside of the cave entry point of the Pokemon you wish to hunt.</p>

    <p><span class="fw-bold">These are -</span> Uxie, Mesprit, Azelf, Heatran & Manaphy.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold">You should now have the bot configured properly and be properly set up in-game, it's now time to begin hunting for a desirable target frame!</span></p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 4 -</span> Searching For A Target<p></p>
<img src="/cfw/la/general/images/spawner-rng/searching-for-a-target-spawner.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<p>After disconnecting the controllers and starting <code class="fw-bold">ArceusBot</code>, the bot will automatically begin scanning the Spawner seed for the legendary Pokemon you are hunting, then refreshing the seed by either cycling through Jublife or resetting the game.</p>

<p>In this case, since Enamorus is the Pokemon being hunted, the bot will continually cycle between Jubilife and Crimson Mirelands until a desirable result has been found. If you picked a Pokemon with a cave method, the bot should enter the cave and reset the game after scanning the spawner seed until a desirable result has been found instead.</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 5 -</span> Target Found!<p></p>
<img src="/cfw/la/general/images/spawner-rng/target-found-spawner.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

<p>We found a 31/0/31/31/31/0 Enamorus in 59 advances (sensitive information has been blocked out to protect my Enamorus), it's now time to begin advancing towards the target frame!</p>

  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Frame advancement methods will differ depending on if your Pokemon is an overworld spawn or is a cave spawn, this section will cover how to advance frames in both of these scenarios.</p>

    <h5 class="fw-bold">Overworld Pokemon & Manaphy:</h5>
    <p><span class="fw-bold">These include -</span> Tornadus, Thundurus, Landorus, Enamorus, Cresselia, Manaphy, Shaymin & Darkrai.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Knockout the legendary.</li>
      <li>Fly to a campsite, then sleep until night, then sleep again until morning.</li>
      <li>Fly to a cave and enter, then save and reboot the game.</li>
      <li>Fly back to the legendary and wait 1 weather cycle for the legendary to respawn.</li>
      <li>Repeat from step 1 until the desired frame has been hit.</li>
      <li>Alternatively, if you wish to advance using the bot you can use <a href="https://github.com/zyro670/NotForkBot.NET/wiki/8.-GenieScanner">this method</a> instead.</li>
    </ol><hr />

    <h5 class="fw-bold">Cave Pokemon (Not Manaphy):</h5>
    <p><span class="fw-bold">These include -</span> Uxie, Mesprit, Azelf & Heatran.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Knockout the legendary.</li>
      <li>Click through the menus until you regain control of your character.</li>
      <li>Repeat from step 1 until the desired frame has been hit.</li>
    </ol><hr />

    <p>You can use PokeViewer.NET to read the current spawned Legendary Pokemon, then compare it to the Sysbot logs output to keep track of your current frame if you get lost along the way.</p>
