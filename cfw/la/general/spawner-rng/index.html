<p>This page offers comprehensive guidance in RNG Legendary & Mythical abusing Pokemon that are associated with Spawner RNG. We'll utilize RNG automation programs developed by <a href="https://github.com/zyro670">Zyro670</a>, as referenced on the main page.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #b60606;">From here it is assumed that you have already followed all of the relevant setup instructions & have read through all the information provided on the introductory page of this guide.</span></p>

  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Getting Started</h1>
</div><hr />

<p>Firstly, you will need to configure SysBot.NET to meet the conditions of your chosen hunt, in this example we will be hunting for Enamorus with a flawless IV spread.</p>

<div class="card border-dark">
  <div class="anchored card-header" style="background-color: #0c0038;" id="sysbot-setup-spawner-rng">
    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Sysbot.NET Setup & Instructions:</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <h5 class="fw-bold">Sysbot.NET Config:</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the Sysbot.NET application once and close it again to generate a <code class="fw-bold">config.json</code> file inside the same folder as Sysbot.NET.</li>
      <li>Open <code class="fw-bold">config.json</code> in a text editor like Notepad, then change the <code class="fw-bold">Mode</code> to 3 in order to use the Legends: Arceus bots, then save the changes.</li>
      <li>Open Sysbot.NET again, you should now see the <code class="fw-bold">Sysbot: Pokemon (LA)</code> in the header, this means the bot has configured for Legends: Arceus successfully.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Next, configure the bot to hunt for your desired Pokemon and set the amount of frames to search through, along with setting your desired StopConditions.</p>

    <h5 class="fw-bold">Spawner RNG Setup:</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the <code class="fw-bold">Hub</code> tab of SysBot, then open the <code class="fw-bold">ArceusLA</code> dropdown menu. This is where you will add the relevant details for your chosen hunt.</li>
      <li>Set the <code class="fw-bold">BotType</code> to the Pokemon you are hunting. For Genies use <code class="fw-bold">GenieScanner</code>, and for anything else use <code class="fw-bold">OtherLegendReset</code>.</li>
      <li>Open the <code class="fw-bold">SpecialConditions</code> dropdown menu, then select the <code class="fw-bold">ScanLocation</code> that matches the location of your chosen hunt.</li>
      <li>For encounters that use the <code class="fw-bold">OtherLegendReset</code> routine, you will also need to select the <code class="fw-bold">TypeOfLegend</code> you are hunting from the dropdown menu.</li>
      <li>If your encounter is contained within a cave, <code class="fw-bold">RunToProfessor</code> should be set to <code class="fw-bold">True</code>, otherwise this can be set to <code class="fw-bold">False</code> to save time.</li>
      <li>Set the <code class="fw-bold">MaxAdvancesToSearch</code> to an amount you are comfortable with, 50-100 advances is recommended as advancements can take a long time depending on your chosen hunt.</li>
      <li>Scroll up to the top, and open the <code class="fw-bold">StopConditions</code> dropdown menu, type in your desired IVs/Nature combination, then restart the bot by closing and re-opening the entire program.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>After properly configuring the bot, head back over to the <code class="fw-bold">Bots</code> tab. Here you will add the bot to the active bots list.</p>

    <details>
      <summary><span class="fw-bold">Adding a bot:</span></summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Type the local IP address of your switch console into the designated field.</li>
        <li>Open the dropdown menu on the right, then select <code class="fw-bold">ArceusBot</code>.</li>
        <li>Click <code class="fw-bold">Add</code> to add the bot to the list of active bots.</li>
        <li>Active bots can then be started by selecting <code class="fw-bold">Start All</code>.</li>
      </ul>

      <small><span class="fw-bold">Note -</span> If you change the StopConditions or details about your desired hunt, you should close and re-open the entire program to ensure these changes take affect.</small>

<p>Your setup should look similar to the above image, the bot type is set to <code class="fw-bold">GenieScanner</code>, <code class="fw-bold">ScanLocation</code> set to Crimson Mirelands, and <code class="fw-bold">StopConditions</code> are set to 31/0/31/31/31/0, these are the configurations used for hunting Enamorus.</p>

  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Setup will differ depending on which Pokemon you are hunting for.</p>

    <p>For Pokemon located <u>in the overworld</u>, you will need to start from Jubilife, then manually enter the map that contains the Pokemon you wish to hunt.</p>

    <p><span class="fw-bold">These are -</span> Tornadus, Thundurus, Landorus, Enamorus, Cresselia, Shaymin & Darkrai.</p>

    <p>For Pokemon located <u>inside caves</u>, you will need to save the game stood outside of the cave entry point of the Pokemon you wish to hunt.</p>

    <p><span class="fw-bold">These are -</span> Uxie, Mesprit, Azelf, Heatran & Manaphy.</p>

    <details>
      <summary><span class="fw-bold">Recommendations:</span></summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Have a strong Pokemon that can easily defeat the Pokemon you wish to RNG abuse within one to two attacks.</li>
        <li>Prepare plenty of throwable items, such as Sticky Glob. You will need to stun the Pokemon to engage in battle.</li>
        <li>Have expendable healing items, such as Potions, Revives and Elixirs. You will be unable to leave the area until you achieve your result.</li>
      </ul>

<p><span class="fw-bold">You should now have the bot configured properly and be properly set up in-game, it's now time to begin hunting for a desirable target frame!</span></p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 4 -</span> Searching For A Target<p></p>
<a href="/cfw/la/general/images/spawner-rng/searching-for-a-target-spawner.gif" target="_blank"><img src="/cfw/la/general/images/spawner-rng/searching-for-a-target-spawner.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"></a><br /><br />

<p>After disconnecting the controllers and starting <code class="fw-bold">ArceusBot</code>, the bot will automatically begin scanning the Spawner seed for the legendary Pokemon you are hunting, then refreshing the seed by either cycling through Jublife or resetting the game.</p>

<p>In this case, since Enamorus is the Pokemon being hunted, the bot will continually cycle between Jubilife and Crimson Mirelands until a desirable result has been found. If you picked a Pokemon with a cave method, the bot should enter the cave and reset the game after scanning the spawner seed until a desirable result has been found instead.</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 5 -</span> Target Found!<p></p>

<p>We found a 31/0/31/31/31/0 Enamorus in 59 advances (sensitive information has been blocked out to protect my Enamorus), it's now time to begin advancing towards the target frame!</p>

  <div class="anchored card-header" style="background-color: #0c0038;" id="advancingtotargetframespawner">
    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Advancing Towards The Target:</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Frame advancement methods will differ depending on if your Pokemon is an forced capture or despawns when defeated, this section will cover how to advance frames in both of these scenarios.</p>

    <h5 class="fw-bold">Despawns When Defeated:</h5>
    <p><span class="fw-bold">These include -</span> Tornadus, Thundurus, Landorus, Enamorus, Shaymin & Darkrai.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Knockout the legendary.</li>
      <li>Fly to a campsite, then sleep until night, then sleep again until evening.</li>
      <li>Fly to a cave and enter, then save and reboot the game.</li>
      <li>Fly back to the legendary and wait 1 weather cycle for the legendary to respawn.</li>
      <li>Repeat from step 1 until the desired frame has been hit.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p><span class="fw-bold">Note -</span> Tornadus, Thundurus and Darkrai only respawn in certain conditions, Tornadus in a Blizzard, Thundurus in a Thunderstorm, and Darkrai at night.</p>
    
    <small>While not required, it is recommended to sleep until evening after step 3, this will guarantee a weather cycle to occur within 3 minutes, otherwise you may be waiting longer than necessary for one to occur.</small>
    <hr />

    <h5 class="fw-bold">Forced Capture:</h5>
    <p><span class="fw-bold">These include -</span> Uxie, Mesprit, Azelf, Heatran & Cresselia.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Knockout the legendary.</li>
      <li>Click through the menus until you regain control of your character.</li>
      <li>Repeat from step 1 until the desired frame has been hit.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><span class="fw-bold">Note - </span>All of these Pokemon are located inside caves except Cresselia, which means you cannot leave the cave once you are already inside, come well prepared!</p>

    <small>These Pokemon are tied to main story quests, which means there is no wait time between encounters whatsoever.</small>
    <hr />

    <h5 class="fw-bold">Unique Cases:</h5>
    <p><span class="fw-bold">These include -</span> Manaphy & Phione.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Knockout the legendary.</li>
      <li>Fly to a campsite, then sleep until night, then sleep again until evening.</li>
      <li>Warp to Fire Pit Island and enter the cave, then save and reboot the game.</li>
      <li>Fly back to the cave that contains Manaphy and wait 1 weather cycle for it to respawn.</li>
      <li>Enter the cave, check to see if your Pokemon has respawned.</li>
      <li>Repeat from step 1 until the desired frame has been hit.</li>
    </ol>

    <small>Manaphy is a unique case in that it does not immediately respawned but is contained inside a cave, so the advancement method is more akin to the method for Overworld legendaries.</small>
    <hr />

    <p>You can use PokeViewer.NET to read the current spawned Legendary Pokemon, then compare it to the Sysbot logs output to keep track of your current frame if you get lost along the way.</p>

    <p>This SysBot fork offers an alternative method to advance frames that artificially alters the game time to simulate sleeping at a campsite, if you wish to use this method then see <a href="https://github.com/zyro670/NotForkBot.NET/wiki/">the Wiki</a> for more information instead.</li>
