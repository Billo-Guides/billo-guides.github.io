<p>This page offers comprehensive guidance in RNG Legendary & Mythical abusing Pokemon that are associated with Spawner RNG. We'll utilize RNG automation programs developed by <a href="https://github.com/zyro670">Zyro670</a>, as referenced on the main page.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #b60606;">From here it is assumed that you have already followed all of the relevant setup instructions & have read through all the information provided on the introductory page of this guide.</span></p>

  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Getting Started</h1>
</div><hr />

<p>First, you will need to configure Zyro670s SysBot.NET for use with Legends: Arceus. Once configured, adjust the settings based on the specific Pokémon you want to hunt.</p>

<p>In this example we will be configuring the program to hunt for an Enamorus with 6 flawless IVs.</p>

  <div class="anchored card-header" style="background-color: #0c0038;" id="sysbot-setup-spawner-rng">
    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Sysbot.NET Setup & Instructions:</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <h5 class="fw-bold">NotForkBot Config:</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>Open <code class="fw-bold">SysBot.exe</code>, then close it again to generate a file named <code class="fw-bold">config.json</code>.</li><p></p>
      <li>Right-click <code class="fw-bold">config.json</code>, then open it with a text editor (e.g Notepad).</li><p></p>
      <li>Edit the <code class="fw-bold">Mode</code> value to 3, then save and close <code class="fw-bold">config.json</code>.</li><p></p>
      <li>Open <code class="fw-bold">SysBot.exe</code> again, confirm that <code class="fw-bold">Sysbot: Pokemon (LA)</code> is present in the header.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>After confirming that Legends: Arceus mode was activated properly, head over to the <code class="fw-bold">Hub</code> tab. This is where you will enter the relevant details about the Pokemon you are hunting.</p>

    <h5 class="fw-bold">Spawner RNG Setup:</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>In the <code class="fw-bold">ArceusLA</code> dropdown menu, set the <code class="fw-bold">BotType</code> to match the Pokemon you are hunting. For the Genies set this to <code class="fw-bold">GenieScanner</code> and for anything else use <code class="fw-bold">OtherLegendReset</code>.</li><p></p>
      <li>Open the <code class="fw-bold">SpecialConditions</code> dropdown menu, then select the correct <code class="fw-bold">ScanLocation</code> based on the Pokemon you are hunting. If you have chosen <code class="fw-bold">OtherLegendReset</code>, select the correct Pokemon under <code class="fw-bold">TypeOfLegend</code> as well.</li><p></p>
      <li>If your encounter is located within a cave, or if you have any issues with using character teleportation, set <code class="fw-bold">RunToProfessor</code> to <code class="fw-bold">True</code>, otherwise you can leave this set to <code class="fw-bold">False</code> to save time.</li><p></p>
      <li>Set <code class="fw-bold">MaxAdvancesToSearch</code> to a comfortable amount; for Pokemon that do not immediately respawn, 50-100 advances are recommended as advancements can take a long time, 200-300 advances are recommended for everything else.</li><p></p>
      <li>In the <code class="fw-bold">StopConditions</code> dropdown menu at the top, enter your desired IVs & Nature, you will need to close and re-open <code class="fw-bold">SysBot.exe</code> every time you change these settings to ensure they have been properly activated.</li><p></p>
      <li>After re-opening <code class="fw-bold">SysBot.exe</code>, enter the local IP address of your console into the assigned field, and select <code class="fw-bold">ArceusLA</code> from the dropdown menu on the right, then add the bot to the list of active bots.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Active bots can be started by clicking the <code class="fw-bold">Start All</code> button, ensure all controllers have been fully disconnected (or JoyCons are attached to the console) before starting bots, connected Pro Controllers will cause the bot to not accept button inputs.</p>
  </div>
</div><br>

<p>Your setup should look similar to the above image, in this example the bot has been configured to search for an Enamorus with 6 perfect IVs.</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="fw-bold">BotType</code> is set to <code class="fw-bold">GenieScanner</code> because Enamorus is a genie.</li>
  <li><code class="fw-bold">ScanLocation</code> has been set to Crimson Mirelands, because that is where Enamorus is located.</li>
  <li><code class="fw-bold">StopConditions</code> have been set to search for an IV spread of 31/0/31/31/31/0.</li>
</ul>

    <span class="fw-bold text-light">In-game Setup:</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Setup will differ depending on which Pokemon you are hunting for.</p>

    <p>For Pokemon located <u>in the overworld</u>, you will need to start from Jubilife, then manually enter the map that contains the Pokemon you wish to hunt.</p>

    <p><span class="fw-bold">These are -</span> Tornadus, Thundurus, Landorus, Enamorus, Cresselia, Shaymin & Darkrai.</p>

    <p>For Pokemon located <u>inside caves</u>, you will need to save the game stood outside of the cave entry point of the Pokemon you wish to hunt.</p>

    <p><span class="fw-bold">These are -</span> Uxie, Mesprit, Azelf, Heatran & Manaphy.</p>

    <details>
      <summary><span class="fw-bold">Recommendations:</span></summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Have a strong Pokemon that can easily defeat the Pokemon you wish to RNG abuse within one to two attacks.</li><p></p>
        <li>Prepare plenty of throwable items, such as Sticky Glob. You will need to stun the Pokemon to engage in battle.</li><p></p>
        <li>Have expendable healing items, such as Potions, Revives and Elixirs. You will be unable to leave the area until you achieve your result.</li>
      </ul>

<p><span class="fw-bold">You should now have the bot configured properly and be properly set up in-game, it's now time to begin hunting for a desirable target frame!</span></p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 4 -</span> Searching For A Target<p></p>

<p>After disconnecting the controllers and starting <code class="fw-bold">ArceusBot</code>, the bot will automatically begin scanning the Spawner seed for the legendary Pokemon you are hunting, then refreshing the seed by either cycling through Jublife or resetting the game.</p>

<p>In this case, since Enamorus is the Pokemon being hunted, the bot will continually cycle between Jubilife and Crimson Mirelands until a desirable result has been found. If you picked a Pokemon with a cave method, the bot should enter the cave and reset the game after scanning the spawner seed until a desirable result has been found instead.</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 5 -</span> Target Found!<p></p>

<p>We found a 31/0/31/31/31/0 Enamorus in 59 advances (sensitive information has been blocked out to protect my Enamorus), it's now time to begin advancing towards the target frame!</p>

<div class="card border-dark">
  <div class="anchored card-header" style="background-color: #0c0038;" id="advancing-to-target-spawner">
    <span class="fw-bold text-light">Advancing Towards The Target:</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Frame advancement methods will differ depending on if your Pokemon is an forced capture or despawns when defeated, this section will cover how to advance frames in both of these scenarios.</p>

    <h5 class="fw-bold">Despawns When Defeated:</h5>
    <p><span class="fw-bold">These include -</span> Tornadus, Thundurus, Landorus, Enamorus, Shaymin & Darkrai.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Knockout the legendary, then fly to a campsite.</li>
      <li>Sleep until night, then sleep again until evening.</li>
      <li>Fly to a cave and enter, then save and reboot the game.</li>
      <li>Fly back to the legendary and wait 1 weather cycle for the legendary to respawn.</li>
      <li>Repeat from step 1 until the desired frame has been hit.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p><span class="fw-bold">Note -</span> Tornadus, Thundurus and Darkrai only respawn in certain conditions, Tornadus in a Blizzard, Thundurus in a Thunderstorm, and Darkrai at night.</p>
    
    <small>While not required, it is recommended to sleep until evening after step 3, this will guarantee a weather cycle to occur within 3 minutes, otherwise you may be waiting longer than necessary for one to occur.</small>
    <hr />

    <h5 class="fw-bold">Forced Capture:</h5>
    <p><span class="fw-bold">These include -</span> Uxie, Mesprit, Azelf, Heatran & Cresselia.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Knockout the legendary.</li>
      <li>Click through the menus until you regain control of your character.</li>
      <li>Repeat from step 1 until the desired frame has been hit.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><span class="fw-bold">Note - </span>All of these Pokemon are located inside caves except Cresselia, which means you cannot leave the cave once you are already inside, come well prepared!</p>

    <small>These Pokemon are tied to main story quests, which means there is no wait time between encounters whatsoever.</small>
    <hr />

    <h5 class="fw-bold">Unique Cases:</h5>
    <p><span class="fw-bold">These include -</span> Manaphy & Phione.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Knockout the legendary, then fly to a campsite.</li>
      <li>Sleep until night, then sleep again until evening.</li>
      <li>Warp to Fire Pit Island and enter the cave, then save and reboot the game.</li>
      <li>Fly back to the cave that contains Manaphy and wait 1 weather cycle for it to respawn.</li>
      <li>Enter the cave, check to see if your Pokemon has respawned.</li>
      <li>Repeat from step 1 until the desired frame has been hit.</li>
    </ol>

    <small>Manaphy is a unique case in that it does not immediately respawned but is contained inside a cave, so the advancement method is more akin to the method for Overworld legendaries.</small>

    <p>The SysBot offers an alternative method to advance frames that artificially alters the game time to simulate sleeping at a campsite, if you wish to use this method then see <a href="https://github.com/zyro670/NotForkBot.NET/wiki/">the Wiki</a> for more information instead.</li>
  </div>
</div><br>

<p>Use <a href="https://github.com/zyro670/PokeViewer.NET/wiki/1.-View">PokeViewer.NET's View function</a> if you lose track of your current frame. Compare the Pokémon's details (IVs, Nature, PID, EC) to the logs from SysBot.NET to determine your exact frame.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold">After advancing 59 frames using the above mentioned method, the 31/0/31/31/31/0 Enamorus has been caught. That's all there is to RNG abusing Spawner RNG based Legendary/Mythical Pokemon!</span></p>
