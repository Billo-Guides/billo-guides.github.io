</div>
<hr />

<p>This section of the guide aims to provide a worked example for how to RNG abuse Arceus. Make sure <u>Autosave is disabled</u> and that you have a <u>full team of 6 Pokemon</u> before beginning this portion of the guide. This provides a safety net for failed targets and makes it easier to check results using PokeViewer.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #b60606;">If you've reached this point, you should have already completed the initial setup and acquired a basic understanding of how to utilize Moarencounterbots and the Main RNG calculation script. Additionally, you should be familiar with using PokeViewer.NET to view Pokemon.</span></p>

    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>You will need to calculate the rough delay for this encounter. The term 'delay' refers to how long it takes for the Pokemon to generate after the final A Press. Since the number of frames that advance during the cutscene is variable, it's important to take a few practice attempts to determine a delay that is consistent for you.</p>

        <h5><span class="fw-bold">Calculating Delay (Step-By-Step)</span></h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Initiate the Arceus boss battle and defeat it, then proceed to the screen of the <a href="/cfw/la/general/images/main-rng/arceus/arceus-final-a-press.png" target="_blank">final A button press</a>.</li>
            <li>Press the <code span class="fw-bold">Home button (⌂)</code>, then open Moarencounterbots and select <code span class="fw-bold">EncBotRNGMonitorLA</code>.</li>
            <li>Head back to the <code span class="fw-bold">Bots</code> tab on Moarencounterbots and start the bot, if done correctly you should now see a seed has been produced in the <code span class="fw-bold">Logs</code> tab.</li>
            <li>Paste your current seed into the Main RNG script, then search without filters. This will be the starting frame.</li>
            <li>Unpause the game and continue mashing the A button to generate Arceus, then inspect it using PokeViewer.</li>
            <li>Copy the PID of the Arceus and use the find function (<code span class="fw-bold">CTRL+F</code>) to search for the PID in your search results.</li>
            <li>Take note of the frame that Arceus was generated on, this will be your delay for this attempt.</li>
            <li>The delay for this encounter is not perfectly stable, it is recommended to repeat this process a few times to get a rough average delay that works for you.</li>
        </ul>

        <small><span class="fw-bold">Note -</span> Defeating Arceus may be difficult at first, so we can use the delay calculation process to also become familiar with how to win the battle!</small>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 1 -</span> Calculating Delay<p></p>
<a href="/cfw/la/general/images/main-rng/arceus/delay-calc-arceus.gif" target="_blank"><img src="/cfw/la/general/images/main-rng/arceus/delay-calc-arceus.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"></a>
<br />
<br />

<p>After following the delay calculation steps and searching for the PID of the encountered Palkia, we find that it was generated on frame 34. Therefore, our delay for this attempt is 34. After 5 attempts, we have the following delay values:</p>


<table class="table table-striped" style="width:100%">
    <thead class="table text-white" style="background-color: #0c0038;">
    <th scope="col">Attempt</th>
    <th scope="col">Delay Value</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><span class="fw-bold">Attempt 1</span></td>
            <td>34</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span class="fw-bold">Attempt 2</span></td>
            <td>36</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span class="fw-bold">Attempt 3</span></td>
            <td>43</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span class="fw-bold">Attempt 4</span></td>
            <td>40</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span class="fw-bold">Attempt 5</span></td>
            <td>37</td>
        </tr>

    </tbody>
</table>

<p>This means a safe delay value to target in future attempts is 2-4. The delay values shown here are based on how quickly I was mash through the final screen before Arceus was generated; your values may vary depending on how quickly you are able to mash the A button to generate Arceus.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold">Now that we have a rough delay range, it's time to focus on finding a suitable seed and target frame.</span></p>>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 2 -</span> Setting Filters<p></p>
<a href="/cfw/la/general/images/main-rng/arceus/filters-arceus.gif" target="_blank"><img src="/cfw/la/general/images/main-rng/arceus/filters-arceus.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"></a>
<br />
<br />

<p>In this example, the filters are configured to search for any Palkia with 6 perfect IVs (31/31/31/31/31/31). You can further customize the filters if desired, such as specifying a particular nature or optimizing for 0 IV values, such as 0 Attack.</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 3 -</span> Target Frame Found<p></p>
<a href="/cfw/la/general/images/main-rng/arceus/target-frame-found-arceus.gif" target="_blank"><img src="/cfw/la/general/images/main-rng/arceus/target-frame-found-arceus.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"></a>
<br />
<br />

<p>Great! We discovered a 6IV Hardy Arceus after 18,241 advances within a cluster of 4. A cluster refers to a group of frames that produce the same end result; the larger the cluster, the greater the chances of hitting the correct target frame.</p>

<p>Now, we need to advance close to our target frame. Monitor your RNG state by running <code span class="fw-bold">EncBotRNGMonitorLA</code> in Moarencounterbots; this will track the number of advancements that occur in real time.</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 4 -</span> RNG State Monitoring Using EncBotRNGMonitorLA<p></p>
<a href="/cfw/la/general/images/main-rng/arceus/rng-state-monitoring.gif" target="_blank"><img src="/cfw/la/general/images/main-rng/arceus/rng-state-monitoring.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"></a>
<br />
<br />

<p>The RNG state at the Spear Pillar advances at a slow rate. Moving to a more populated area allows you to advance the RNG state much more quickly. In the example image above, the player is standing next to a large body of water in an area densely populated with Pokemon.</p>

<p>Consider leaving Spear Pillar and heading to a location where the RNG state advances more rapidly if you need to cover a large amount of frame advancements. If you have moved locations, make sure to leave enough time to reposition yourself to avoid overshooting your target frame.</p>

<details>
<summary><span class="fw-bold">Example</span></summary>
<p>If it takes you roughly 3,000 frames to get back to Spear Pillar from your position, and roughly 7,000 frames to defeat Arceus, start to head back to Spear Pillar at roughly 10,000 frames away from your target, leave enough time to reposition yourself to avoid overshooting!</p>
</details><p></p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 5 -</span> Advancing To The Target<p></p>
<a href="/cfw/la/general/images/main-rng/arceus/advancing-to-target-arceus.png" target="_blank"><img src="/cfw/la/general/images/main-rng/arceus/advancing-to-target-arceus.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"></a>
<br />
<br />

<p>We are now back at Spear Pillar and 6,255 frames away from the target, it can take up to 10,000 advances to defeat the Arceus boss on average, it is recommended to check how long it takes you to win, as any time during or after the Arceus battle will advance the RNG state slowly.</p>

<p>On average it takes me 5,000-7,000 frames to defeat the boss, so there is enough time to defeat it and position myself on the screen of the final A press and ultimately to avoid overshooting the target frame.</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 6 -</span> Screen Of Final Button Press<p></p>
<a href="/cfw/la/general/images/main-rng/arceus/arceus-final-a-press.png" target="_blank"><img src="/cfw/la/general/images/main-rng/arceus/arceus-final-a-press.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"></a>
<br />
<br />

<p>Get to the screen of the final A press (pictured above), and let <code span class="fw-bold">EncBotRNGMonitorLA</code> run until the Logs tab displays the correct target frame. You can use the <code span class="fw-bold">Home button (⌂)</code> to close in on your target frame at your own pace.</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 7 -</span> Hitting The Target Frame<p></p>
<a href="/cfw/la/general/images/main-rng/arceus/hitting-target-frame-arceus.png" target="_blank"><img src="/cfw/la/general/images/main-rng/arceus/hitting-target-frame-arceus.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"></a>
<br />
<br />

<p>Here we can see the target is now on frame 217 after re-entering the seed. The calculated delay from earlier is roughly ~36. This means that once the Sysbot log output displays that we are on frame ~182 we have reached the desired target frame.</p>

<p><code span class="fw-bold">x (earliest target frame) - y (delay) = z (frame to press A)</code></p>

<p>It is now time to begin spamming the <code span class="fw-bold">A button</code> as quickly as possible, then inspect the Arceus using <a href="https://github.com/zyro670/PokeViewer.NET/wiki/2.-Box-View">PokeViewer.NET Box Viewer</a> to see if we hit the correct target.</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 8 -</span> Result Found!<p></p>

<br />
<br />

<p><span class="fw-bold">We hit our target frame and have secured a Arceus with 6 perfect IVs! That's all there is to it!</span></p>

<p><small><span class="fw-bold">Final Note -</span> Keen eyed readers may notice that the example uses PKHeX to view the box slot that contains our Pokemon, PokeViewer is considered to be more user friendly and does the same job.</small></p>
