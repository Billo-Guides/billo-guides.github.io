<p>This section of the guide aims to provide a worked example for how to RNG abuse Giratina. Ensure that the <u>Autosave is disabled</u> before attempting to follow this guide.</p>

    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>You will need to calculate the rough delay for this encounter. The term 'delay' refers to how long it takes for the Pokemon to generate after the final A Press. Since the number of frames that advance during the cutscene is variable, it's important to take a few practice attempts to determine a delay that is consistent for you.</p>

        <p>By pressing the <code span class="fw-bold">Y Button</code> the player will tumble in whatever direction they are currently facing. This movement tech is used to enter the cutscene loading zone that initiates the battle with Giratina. For the purposes of this guide this will be referred to as the <a class="clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/la/main-rng/giratina/giratina-tumble-method-positioning.gif">Tumble Method</a>.</p>

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">Calculating Delay (Step-By-Step)</span></h6>
        <ul>
            <li>Save outside Giratina as close as you can before the cutscene loading zone, anywhere within a single "tumble" distance is acceptable.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Press the <code span class="fw-bold">Home button (⌂)</code> to freeze the RNG state, then check your current seed by running <code span class="fw-bold">EncBotCopySeedLA</code> in Moarencounterbots.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Paste your seed produced in the <code span class="fw-bold">Logs</code> tab into the Main RNG script, then search without filters. This will provide the starting frame.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Quickly unpause the game, then quickly tumble towards Giratina (using above GIF as a reference) to initiate the cutscene and enter the battle.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Use PokeViewer.NET <code span class="fw-bold">View</code> function to read the details of the encounter, take note of the PID of the Giratina.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Search for the PID in the search results of the Main RNG script, you can manually search through results or use <code span class="fw-bold">CTRL+F</code>).</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Take note of advancement that generated Giratina, this will be your delay for this attempt. Repeat this process a few more times to get a rough average delay.</li>

<p>After following the delay calculation steps and searching for the PID of the encountered Giratina, we find that it was generated on advance 46. Therefore, our delay for this attempt is 46. After 5 attempts, we have the following delay values:</p>

<table class="table table-striped" style="width:100%">
    <thead class="table text-white" style="background-color: #6f3b97;">
    <th scope="col">Attempt</th>

            <td>45</td>
        </tr>

    </tbody>
</table>

<p>This means a safe delay value to target in future attempts is 45-55. The delay values shown here are based on how quickly I was able to use the tumble method to initiate the battle, your results may vary.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold">Now that we have a rough delay range, it's time to focus on finding a suitable seed and target frame.</span></p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 2 -</span> Setting Search Filters<p></p>

<p>In this example, the filters are configured to search for any Giratina with 6 perfect IVs (31/31/31/31/31/31). You can further customize the filters if desired, such as specifying a particular nature or optimizing for 0 IV values, such as 0 Attack.</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 3 -</span> Target Found<p></p>

<p>Great! We discovered a Adamant natured Giratina in 8544-8549 advances within a cluster of 6. A cluster refers to a group of frames that produce the same end result; the larger the cluster, the greater the chances of hitting the correct target frame.</p>

<p>Now, we need to advance close to our target frame. Monitor your RNG state by running <code span class="fw-bold">EncBotRNGMonitorLA</code> in Moarencounterbots; this will track the number of advancements that occur in real time.</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 4 -</span> Monitoring RNG State<p></p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/la/main-rng/giratina/rng-state-monitoring.gif" alt="main-rng-giratina-4" class="img-fluid clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/la/main-rng/giratina/rng-state-monitoring.gif"><p></p>

<p>The RNG state at in Turnback Cave advances at a slow rate. Moving to a more populated area allows you to advance the RNG state much more quickly. In the example image above, the player is standing next to a large body of water in an area densely populated with Pokemon.</p>

<p>Consider leaving Turnback Cave and heading to a location where the RNG state advances more rapidly if you need to cover a large amount of frame advancements. If you have moved locations, make sure to leave enough time to reposition yourself to avoid overshooting your target frame.</p>

<details>
    <summary><span class="fw-bold">Example</span></summary>
    <p>If it takes you roughly 3,000 frames to get back to Giratina from your position, start to head back to it at roughly ~3500 frames away from your target, leave enough time to reposition yourself to avoid overshooting!</p>
</details><p></p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 5 -</span> Advancing To The Target<p></p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/la/main-rng/giratina/advancing-to-target-giratina.png" alt="main-rng-giratina-5" class="img-fluid clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/la/main-rng/giratina/advancing-to-target-giratina.png"><p></p>

<p>We are now back inside Giratina's cave and 314-319 frames away from the target, while standing as close to Giratina as possible without triggering the cutscene.</p>

<p>Stand as close as possible to Giratina without triggering the cutscene (pictured above), and let <code span class="fw-bold">EncBotRNGMonitorLA</code> run until the Logs tab displays the correct target frame. You can use the <code span class="fw-bold">Home button (⌂)</code> to close in on your target frame at your own pace.</p>

<p><code span class="fw-bold">x (earliest target frame) - y (delay) = z (frame to press A)</code></p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 6 -</span> Hitting The Target Frame<p></p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/la/main-rng/giratina/hitting-target-frame-giratina.png" alt="main-rng-giratina-6" class="img-fluid clickable-image" data-image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billo-PS/billo-guides-images/refs/heads/main/cfw/la/main-rng/giratina/hitting-target-frame-giratina.png"><p></p>

<p>Here we can see the target is now on frame 97-102 after re-entering the seed into the script. The calculated delay from earlier is roughly ~45. This means that once the SysBot log output displays that we are on frame 52 we have reached the desired target frame and can use the tumble method to initiate the Giratina cutscene.</p>

<p>Once you reach the expected target frame, unpause the game and quickly use the tumble method to initiate the cutscene, then inspect the Giratina using <a href="https://github.com/zyro670/PokeViewer.NET/wiki/">PokeViewer.NET View function</a> to see if the correct target frame was hit.</p>

<p>In the example above, we tumbled into the Giratina cutscene zone on frame 52, and hit frame 101, which should produce an Adamant natured, 6IV Giratina.</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 7 -</span> Result Found!<p></p>

<p><span class="fw-bold">We hit our target frame and have secured a Giratina with 6 perfect IVs! That's all there is to it!</span></p>
