<p>This section of the guide aims to provide a worked example for how to RNG abuse the Origin Form Legendary Pokemon, Dialga/Palkia.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #b60606;">If you have made it this far, you should already have the initial setup completed and have a general understanding of how to use Moarencounterbots and the RNG calculation scripts, as well as understanding how to use PKHeX/Livehex to view Pokemon.</span></p>

        <p>Pick the method you wish to use for this encounter, Dialga/Palkia are generated at different times depending on the method used. There are two possible methods, these will be named <u>Cutscene Method</u> & <u>Death Method</u>.</p>

        <p><span class="fw-bold">Read the descriptions below and choose a method based on your skill level, then click on one of the hyperlinks to get started.</span></p><hr />

        <h5><a href="#cutscenemethod">Cutscene Method:</a></h5>
        <p>This method involves skipping a cutscene in order to engage a battle with Dialga/Palkia. They will be generated when you enter the boss battle from the cutscene.</p>

        <p>You need to be able to consistently defeat the boss battle without dying. Losing to the boss will force the Pokemon to regenerate and you will miss your target frame.</p><hr />

        <h5><a href="#deathmethod">Death Method:</a></h5>
        <p>This method involves dying towards the end of the battle with Dialga/Palkia. They will be regenerated when you re-enter the battle from the continue screen.</p>

        <p>This method is more forgiving as you are allowed to lose to the boss battle without missing your target, but will involve waiting for a longer time period before reaching your target frame.</p>

    <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Cutscene Method</h1>
</div>
<hr />

<p>If you are reading this text you have decided to use the Cutscene Method, here you can find a worked example of how to RNG abuse Origin Dialga/Palkia using this method.</p>

        <p>You will need to calculate the rough delay for this encounter. The term "delay" is used to describe how long it take for the Pokemon to generate after the final A Press. The amount of frames that advance during the cutscene is variable, so it is important to take a few practice attempts to figure out a delay that is consistent for you.</p>

        <p>It is recommended to <u>disable Autosave</u> and have <u>a full team of 6 Pokemon</u> so that our target Pokemon is sent to boxes. Sending the Pokemon to boxes will make it easier to view using Livehex (viewable when the credits roll begins instead of after the credits).</p><hr />

        <h5><span class="fw-bold">Calculating Delay (Step-By-Step)</span></h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Open the game and enter the cutscene before the boss battle, then press the <code span class="fw-bold">A button</code> until you reach the screen of the final A press. (<a href="/cfw/la/general/images/main-rng/origin/final-a-press-cutscene-method.jpg">This screen</a>!)</li>
            <li>Enter the Switch home menu to freeze the RNG state, then check your current seed by running <code span class="fw-bold">EncBotCopySeedLA</code> in Moarencounterbots.</li>
            <li>Paste in your current seed into the RNG script, then search without filters. This will provide the starting frame.</li>
            <li>Press the <code span class="fw-bold">Home button (⌂)</code> again to unpause the game and quickly press the <code span class="fw-bold">A button</code>. The cutscene will begin and then fade out to a black screen.</li>
            <li>Once the next part of the cutscene loads, attempt to skip it as fast as possible by pressing the <code span class="fw-bold">+ button</code> followed by the <code span class="fw-bold">X button</code>.</li>
            <li>Defeat the boss and inspect it using PKHeX/Livehex to find the frame it was generated on. That will be your delay for this attempt.</li>
        </ul>
        <small><span class="fw-bold">Remember:</span> Losing the boss battle will cause the boss to regenerate, this means your delay will not be accurate, make sure you have the skill to defeat the boss in one attempt or consider using the <a href="#deathmethod">Death Method</a> instead.</small>

<br />
<br />

<p>After following the delay calculation steps, after searching for the PID of the Palkia we hit and matching the IVs/Nature, we can see that it was generated on frame 58. This means our delay for this attempt is 58. After 5 attempts we have the following delay values:</p>

<table class="table table-striped" style="width:100%">
    <thead class="table text-white" style="background-color: #0c0038;">
    <th scope="col">Attempt</th>
    <th scope="col">Delay Value</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><span class="fw-bold">Attempt 1</span></td>
            <td>58</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span class="fw-bold">Attempt 2</span></td>
            <td>57</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span class="fw-bold">Attempt 3</span></td>
            <td>65</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span class="fw-bold">Attempt 4</span></td>

            <td>58</td>
        </tr>

    </tbody>
</table>

<p>This means a safe delay value to target in future attempts is 58-65. The delay values shown here are based on how quickly I was able to skip the cutscene and enter the battle with Palkia, your values may vary if you skip the cutscene at a different speed, or do not skip the cutscene at all.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold">Now that we have a rough delay, it's time to get to work on finding a suitable seed and target frame!</span></p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 2 -</span> Setting Filters<p></p>

<br />
<br />

<p>In this example the filters are set to search for any Palkia with 6 perfect IVs (31/31/31/31/31/31), you can be more specific with the filters if you wish, such as filtering for a specific nature, or optimal 0 IV values such as 0 Atk.</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 3 -</span> Target Frame Found<p></p>
<a href="/cfw/la/general/images/main-rng/origin/target-frame-found-origin-cutscene-method.gif" target="_blank"><img src="/cfw/la/general/images/main-rng/origin/target-frame-found-origin-cutscene-method.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"></a>
<br />
<br />

<p>Great! We found a 6IV Docile Palkia in 24,864 advances in a cluster of 4, a cluster is a group of frames that produce the same end result, the larger the cluster the more chances you have of hitting the correct target frame.</p>

<p>We now need to advance to close to our target frame, monitor your RNG state by running <code span class="fw-bold">EncBotRNGMonitorLA</code> in Moarencounterbots, this will track the amount of advancements that have occured in real time.</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 4 -</span> RNG State Monitoring Using EncBotRNGMonitorLA<p></p>

<br />
<br />

<p>The RNG state at the Spear Pillar advances at a slow rate. By moving to a more populated area you can advance the RNG state at a much quicker rate, in the example image above the player is stood next to a large body of water in an area that is densely populated with Pokemon.</p>

<p>Consider leaving Spear Pillar and heading somewhere where the RNG state advances more rapidly if you need to cover a large amount of frame advancements. <span class="fw-bold">If you have moved location, leave enough time to reposition yourself to avoid overshooting!</span></p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 5 -</span> Advancing To The Target<p></p>

<br />
<br />

<p>We are now back at Spear Pillar and ~2253 frames away from the target, earlier we calculated a rough delay of 58-65, which means the goal is now to press the A button on frame ~2,188-2195, then skip the cutscene as fast as possible.</p>

<p><code span class="fw-bold">2253 (target) - 58 (delay) = 2195 (new target)</code></p>

<p><span class="fw-bold">Now it's time to defeat the boss, then inspect the Palkia using PKHeX/Livehex to see if we hit the correct target frame!</span></p>

<p>The RNG state at the Spear Pillar advances slowly. By moving to a more populated area you can advance the RNG state at a much quicker rate, for example in an area heavily populated with wild Pokemon, or next to a body of water.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold">It can take between 1000-5,000 advancements to whittle it down to a single bar of HP depending on your skill level. Leave yourself enough time to head back to Spear Pillar and whittle down the boss' HP bar to ensure you do not overshoot the target.</span></p>

<p>The boss is down to a single bar of HP and we are close to the target frame, it's time to let the boss win by taking damage until the trainer blacks out.</p>

<p>Get to <a href="/cfw/la/general/images/main-rng/origin/final-a-press-death-method.jpg">the screen of the final A press</a>, and let <code span class="fw-bold">EncBotRNGMonitorLA</code> run until the Logs tab displays the correct target frame, then press the A button to regenerate the boss as quickly as possible for the best chance of success.</p>

<br />
<br />

<p>Subtract the delay from the target frame to calculate the frame of the final A press, earlier we calculated a rough delay of 3, and the target frame after re-checking the current seed is 779, this means the frame we should aim to press the A button on is 776-779.</p>
