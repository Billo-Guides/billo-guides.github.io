<hr />

<p>This section of the guide aims to provide a worked example for how to RNG abuse the Origin Form Legendary Pokemon, Dialga/Palkia.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #b60606;">If you've reached this point, you should have already completed the initial setup and acquired a basic understanding of how to utilize Moarencounterbots and the Main RNG calculation script. Additionally, you should be familiar with using PokeViewer.NET to view Pokemon.</span></p>

        <span class="fw-bold text-light">Picking Your Method:</span>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>Choose the method you prefer for this encounter; Dialga/Palkia are generated at different times depending on the method used. The two available methods will be named the <u>Cutscene Method</u> and the <u>Death Method</u>. After reviewing the descriptions of each method, choose the one that best suits your preferences and click the hyperlink to jump to the relevant section.</p><hr />

        <h5><a href="#cutscene-method">Cutscene Method:</a></h5>
        <h6><small>This method is for more exerienced players.</small></h6>
        <p>Cutscene method requires skipping a cutscene at a precise moment in order to initiate a battle with Dialga/Palkia. The internal details of the Pokemon will be generated after skipping the cutscene and triggering the boss battle.</p>

        <p>If you choose this method, it's crucial to be capable of consistently defeating the boss battle without losing. Losing to the boss will cause the Pokemon to regenerate, causing you to miss your target frame.</p>

        <h5><a href="#death-method">Death Method:</a></h5>
        <h6><small>This method is beginner friendly.</small></h6>
        <p>The Death Method involves intentionally losing towards the end of the battle with Dialga/Palkia. The internal details of the Pokemon will regenerate after re-entering the battle from the continue screen. This allows you to retain your boss battle progress and defeat the boss more easily.</p>

        <p>This method is more forgiving because you're allowed to lose to the boss battle without missing your target. However, it will involve waiting for a longer time period before reaching your target frame.</p>

    <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Cutscene Method</h1>
</div><hr />

<p>If you are reading this text you have decided to use the Cutscene Method, here you can find a worked example of how to RNG abuse Origin Dialga/Palkia using this method. Losing the boss battle will cause it to regenerate, which will make your results inaccurate. Make sure you can defeat the boss in one attempt or consider using the <a href="#death-method">Death Method</a> instead.</p>

<p>Make sure <u>Autosave is disabled</u> and that you have a <u>full team of 6 Pokemon</u> before beginning this portion of the guide. This provides a safety net for failed targets and makes it easier to check results using PokeViewer.</p>

<div class="card border-dark">
    <div class="anchored card-header" style="background-color: #0c0038;" id="cutscene-method-delay-calculation">
        <span class="fw-bold text-light">Getting Started (Delay Calculation):</span>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>You will need to calculate the rough delay for this encounter. The term 'delay' refers to how long it takes for the Pokemon to generate after the final A Press. Since the number of frames that advance during the cutscene is variable, it's important to take a few practice attempts to determine a delay that is consistent for you.</p>

        <p>Open the game and enter the cutscene before the boss battle, then press the <code span class="fw-bold">A button</code> until you reach the screen of the screen of the <a href="/cfw/la/general/images/main-rng/origin/final-a-press-cutscene-method.jpg" target="_blank">final A button press</a>. From here, pick the method you want to use.</p><hr /> 

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">Method 1 (Immediate Cutscene Skip)</span></h6>
        <p>This method is simpler since you only target one delay, but will require you to be consistent at skipping the cutscene.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Press the <code span class="fw-bold">Home button (⌂)</code> to freeze the RNG state, then check your current seed by running <code span class="fw-bold">EncBotCopySeedLA</code> in Moarencounterbots.</li>
            <li>Paste your current seed into the Main RNG script, then search without filters. This will provide the starting frame.</li>
            <li>Press the <code span class="fw-bold">Home button (⌂)</code> to unpause the game and quickly press the <code span class="fw-bold">A button</code>. The cutscene will begin and then fade out to a black screen.</li>
            <li>Once the next part of the cutscene loads, attempt to skip it as fast as possible by pressing the <code span class="fw-bold">+ button</code> followed by the <code span class="fw-bold">X button</code>.</li>
            <li>Defeat the boss and inspect the result using PokeViewer to find the frame it was generated on. That will be your delay for this attempt.</li>
        </ul><hr />

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">Method 2 (Targeted Cutscene Skip)</span></h6>
        <p>This method may be more consistent, but requires approximating the first delay in order to more precisely hit a second delay. The suggestion is to press A on the <a href="/cfw/la/general/images/main-rng/origin/final-a-press-cutscene-method.jpg" target="_blank">final A button press screen</a> when you are roughly 130 advancements away from your target frame.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Press the <code span class="fw-bold">Home button (⌂)</code>, then connect <code span class="fw-bold">EncBotRNGMonitorLA</code> in Moarencounterbots. Set <code span class="fw-bold">BotEncounter > EncounterLA > MonitorRefreshRate</code> to 0.</li>
            <li>Press the <code span class="fw-bold">Home button (⌂)</code>, then press the <code span class="fw-bold">A button</code> to start the cutscene (this should be performed at around 130 advances before your target frame).</li>
            <li>Press the <code span class="fw-bold">+ button</code> to open the option to skip the cutscene, observe the <code span class="fw-bold">Logs</code> of Moarencounterbots until 110-120 frames have passed.</li>
            <li>Press the <code span class="fw-bold">Home button (⌂)</code> to freeze the RNG state, then check your current seed by running <code span class="fw-bold">EncBotCopySeedLA</code> in Moarencounterbots.</li>
            <li>Paste your current seed into the Main RNG script, then search without filters. This will provide the starting frame.</li>
            <li>Press the <code span class="fw-bold">Home button (⌂)</code> to unpause the game and quickly press the <code span class="fw-bold">X button</code> to skip the cutscene when you are around 0-5 frames away from your target.</li>
            <li>Defeat the boss and inspect the result using PokeViewer to find the frame it was generated on. That will be your delay for this attempt.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>
<br>

<p>The example will continue with the Immediate Cutscene Skip method, but you can use the Targeted Cutscene Skip in a similar fashion.</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 1 -</span> Calculating Delay (Cutscene Method)<p></p>
<a href="/cfw/la/general/images/main-rng/origin/delay-calc-origin-cutscene-method.png" target="_blank"><img src="/cfw/la/general/images/main-rng/origin/delay-calc-origin-cutscene-method.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"></a>
<br />
<br />

<p>After following the delay calculation steps and searching for the PID of the encountered Palkia, we find that it was generated on frame 58. Therefore, our delay for this attempt is 58. After 5 attempts, we have the following delay values:</p>

<table class="table table-striped" style="width:100%">
    <thead class="table text-white" style="background-color: #0c0038;">
    <th scope="col">Attempt</th>
    <th scope="col">Delay Value</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><span class="fw-bold">Attempt 1</span></td>
            <td>58</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span class="fw-bold">Attempt 2</span></td>
            <td>57</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span class="fw-bold">Attempt 3</span></td>
            <td>65</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span class="fw-bold">Attempt 4</span></td>
            <td>62</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span class="fw-bold">Attempt 5</span></td>
            <td>58</td>
        </tr>

    </tbody>
</table>

<p>This means a safe delay value to target in future attempts is 58-65. The displayed delay values are based on how quickly I was able to skip the cutscene and enter the battle with Palkia; your values may vary depending on the speed at which you skip the cutscene or if you choose not to skip it at all.</p>

<p><span class="fw-bold">Now that we have a rough delay range, it's time to focus on finding a suitable seed and target frame.</span></p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 2 -</span> Setting Filters<p></p>

<br />
<br />

<p>In this example, the filters are configured to search for any Palkia with 6 perfect IVs (31/31/31/31/31/31). You can further customize the filters if desired, such as specifying a particular nature or optimizing for 0 IV values, such as 0 Attack.</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 3 -</span> Target Frame Found<p></p>

<br />
<br />

<p>Great! We discovered a 6IV Docile Palkia after 24,864 advances within a cluster of 4. A cluster refers to a group of frames that produce the same end result; the larger the cluster, the greater the chances of hitting the correct target frame.</p>

<p>Now, we need to advance close to our target frame. Monitor your RNG state by running <code span class="fw-bold">EncBotRNGMonitorLA</code> in Moarencounterbots; this will track the number of advancements that occur in real time.</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 4 -</span> RNG State Monitoring Using EncBotRNGMonitorLA<p></p>
<a href="/cfw/la/general/images/main-rng/origin/rng-state-monitoring.gif" target="_blank"><img src="/cfw/la/general/images/main-rng/origin/rng-state-monitoring.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"></a>
<br />
<br />

<p>The RNG state at the Spear Pillar advances at a slow rate. Moving to a more populated area allows you to advance the RNG state much more quickly. In the example image above, the player is standing next to a large body of water in an area densely populated with Pokemon.</p>

<p>Consider leaving Spear Pillar and heading to a location where the RNG state advances more rapidly if you need to cover a large amount of frame advancements. If you have moved locations, make sure to leave enough time to reposition yourself to avoid overshooting your target frame.</p>

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 5 -</span> Advancing To The Target<p></p>
<a href="/cfw/la/general/images/main-rng/origin/advancing-to-target-cutscene-method.gif" target="_blank"><img src="/cfw/la/general/images/main-rng/origin/advancing-to-target-cutscene-method.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"></a>
<br />
<br />

<p>We are now back at Spear Pillar and approximately 2253 frames away from the target. Earlier, we calculated a rough delay of 58-65, which means the goal now is to press the A button on frame approximately 2188-2195, then skip the cutscene as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><code span class="fw-bold">2253 (target) - 58 (delay) = 2195 (new target)</code></p>

<p>It is now time to defeat the boss, then inspect the Palkia using <a href="https://github.com/zyro670/PokeViewer.NET/wiki/2.-Box-View">PokeViewer.NET Box Viewer</a> to see if we hit the correct target.</p>

<p>This means a safe delay value to target in future attempts is 2-4. The delay values shown here are based on how quickly I was able to restart the battle with Palkia; your values may vary depending on how quickly you are able to re-enter the battle.</p>

<p>Great! We discovered a 6IV Hardy Palkia after 49,350 advances within a cluster of 9. A cluster refers to a group of frames that produce the same end result; the larger the cluster, the greater the chances of hitting the correct target frame.</p>

<p>Now, we need to advance close to our target frame. Monitor your RNG state by running <code span class="fw-bold">EncBotRNGMonitorLA</code> in Moarencounterbots; this will track the number of advancements that occur in real time.</p>

<p>The boss is down to a single bar of HP and we are close to the target frame, it's time to let the boss win by taking damage until the trainer blacks out.</p>

<p>Get to <a href="/cfw/la/general/images/main-rng/origin/final-a-press-death-method.jpg">the screen of the final A press</a>, and let <code span class="fw-bold">EncBotRNGMonitorLA</code> run until the Logs tab displays the correct target frame, then press the A button to regenerate the boss as quickly as possible for the best chance of success.</p>

<br />
<br />

<p>Subtract the delay from the target frame to calculate the frame of the final A press, earlier we calculated a rough delay of 3, and the target frame after re-checking the current seed is 779, this means the frame we should aim to press the A button on is 776-779.</p>

<p><code span class="fw-bold">779 (target frame) - 3 (rough delay) = 776 (frame to press A)</code></p>
