        <p>The main purpose of this project is to provide in-depth guides for different types of RNG manipulation (or RNG abuse) in Pok&eacute;mon games. All guides provided on this site will be written to the best extent of my knowledge and will be quality checked and tested before publishing for public consumption.</p>

        <p>All guides are written in a way that is easy to understand and follow, even for those who are new to RNG manipulation. The guides will also include detailed explanations of the concepts and techniques used in RNG manipulation, as well as practical examples and step-by-step instructions.</p>

        <p>If you believe that some aspects of a particular guide could be improved or better written, the best way to leave feedback is to contact me on Discord, the invite link to my support server can be found at the top of any page. Alternatively, if you would like to add guides or modify existing guides yourself, consider submitting a Pull Request on GitHub.</p>

        <p>You can use the navigation bar at the top of this page to jump to your page of interest. Note that all guides will be written in English, and no on-site local translations will be provided. It is recommended to translate the guides using Google Translate if you are running into comprehension issues.</p>
