<h2>About this project...</h2>

The goal of this project is to provide in-depth guides for different types of RNG abuse in Pokemon games. All guides will be written to the best extent of my knowledge and will be quality checked before publishing for public consumption.<br /><br />
  
This page currently facilitates guides for:
<ul>
  <li>Sword/Shield - Overworld (Retail & CFW methods!)</li>
  <li>Sword/Shield - Item (Retail & CFW methods!)</li>

You can use the navigation bar at the top of this page to jump to your page of interest.<br /><br />
  
Any & all feedback is welcome. If you believe something is unclear, unoptimized or simply outdated, you can contact me on Discord at <code>Lo#4758</code>. I'm open to guide collaboration too!<br /><br />
